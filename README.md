# NovelAnalyzer

A sort of school related project to run natural language processing algorithms on novels. The main focus is on plotting sentiment analysis throughout the story to see how the narrator's mood changes over time.

This project uses SFML-Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for graphics! The library is not included in the source code, but you can find it here: https://www.sfml-dev.org
