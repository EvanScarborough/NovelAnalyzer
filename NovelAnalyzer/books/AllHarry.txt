CHAPTER 1

A neighbourhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.



Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.



The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.



McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?



Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.

McGonagall: And the boy?

Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.

McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

Albus: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.



There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.



Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.

Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?

Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.



Hagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.



McGonagall: Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are

Dumbledore: The only family he has.



They stop outside a house.



McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.

Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.



Hagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.



Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.



Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.



Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.



The camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:

HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE


Almost ten years after the: DURSLEY's home. The camera pans on a sleeping boy, almost eleven, with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.

There is a click, and knocking. Outside, a tall woman, PETUNIA DURSLEY, raps the door.



Petunia: Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}



A large, tubby boy, DUDLEY DURSLEY, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.



Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!



Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley.



Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.



Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!



A larger man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.



Vernon: Happy birthday, son.



Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in rags.



Petunia: Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.

Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.



He sets to work.



Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.

Vernon: Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!

Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.



Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.



Dudley: How many are there?

Vernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.

Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!

Vernon: Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!

Dudley: I don't care how big they are!

Petunia: Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?



Scene:

Outside, morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry goes to get in but is stopped by Vernon.



Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.

Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.



Scene:

The zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large BOA CONSTRICTOR.



Dudley: Make it move.

Vernon raps the glass of the cage.



Vernon: Move!



Dudley raps the glass much harder, and Vernon winces.



Dudley: MOVE!

Harry: He's asleep!

Dudley: He's boring.



Dudley and his parents retreat to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.



Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.



The snake looks up and blinks.



Harry: Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.



The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He rips over to the cage, knocking Harry to the floor.



Dudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!



Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears. Dudley wretches forward.



Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!



Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.



Snake: Thankssssssss.

Harry: Anytime.



The snake starts off.



Man: SNAKE!



There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. He is stuck. He pounds the glass.



Dudley: Mum, mummy!

Petunia: {Sees him} AHH!

Dudley: Mum, help! Help me!

Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?!

Harry: {Grins and giggles}



Vernon glares down at him and Harry's grin disappears. Petunia continues screaming: How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!



Scene:

Back at the Dursley's. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.

Petunia: It's all right. It's all right.



They disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.



Harry: Ow!

Vernon: What happened?

Harry: I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!

Vernon: {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!



Scene:

Outside, some time later. An owl flies by the house and drops a letter, which zooms in the letterbox. It lands away from the house and hoots.

Harry, inside, goes to collect the mail. He sorts through the letters and sees his, addressed to him. He goes into the kitchen, hands Vernon the rest of the mail, and walks around the other side of the table to see his letter.



Vernon: Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

Dudley: {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!

Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!

Vernon: {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?



The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps.



Scene:

Another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up.

In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.



Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.



Scene:

Outside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.



Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.



She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.



Vernon: Shoo! Go on!



Scene:

Inside. Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in.



Scene:

Living/Family room. The family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.



Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?



Dudley shrugs.



Harry: {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---



A letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernons face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.



Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}

Petunia and Vernon: {Screaming}

Vernon: Go away, ahh!

Dudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!



Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.



Vernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!



He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.



Harry: Get off! Ahh!

Vernon: Ahh!

Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!

Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!

Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!



Scene:

A house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor. He has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.



Harry: Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}



Suddenly, the door thumps. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Petunia and Vernon appear, Vernon with a gun. The door bangs again and then cracks open, and a giant man appears.



Vernon: Who's there? Ahh!

Hagrid: Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}

Vernon: I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!

Petunia: Ooh.



Hagrid comes over, grabs the gun and bends it upwards.



Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}

All: Ahh!

Hagrid: {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!

Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.

Harry appears: I-I am.

Hagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.

Harry: Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads: Happee Birdae Harry.}

Hagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?



Hagrid sits down on the couch, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Poof, poof! Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gapes.



Harry: {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?

Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.

Harry: Sorry, no.

Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?

Harry: Learnt what?

Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.

Harry: I-I'm a what?

Harry: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.

Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.

Hagrid: Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.

Dudley: {whimpers}



Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.



Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!

Vernon: Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!

Harry: You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?

Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

Harry: Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!

Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?

Petunia: We had to tell him something.

Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

Vernon: He'll not be going!

Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?

Harry: Muggle?

Hagrid: Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.

Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!

Hagrid: {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.



Hagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and points the umbrella at his rear. A grey tail grows.



Dudley: Ahh!

All: Ahh! {family chases Dudley}

Harry: {laughs}

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.

Harry: {Nods} Okay.

Hagrid: {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}



Harry grins, looks back, and grins again.



Scene:

Streets of London. Hagrid and Harry are walking.

Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?

Hagrid: If you know where to go.



They go to a corner store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.

{Music and talking}



Barkeep Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.

Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.



The pub goes silent. A man comes up and shakes Harrys hand.



Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.



A witch comes up and shakes Harrys hand, as well.



Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.



A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is PROFESSOR QUIRRELL.



Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.

Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}

Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.

Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.

Harry: Good-bye.



The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.



Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!

Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?

Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}

Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. 



Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.



Hagrid: Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.



Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.



Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.

Hagrid: Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.



Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working.



Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?

Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.



The goblin looks up.



Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?

Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}

Goblin: Very well.



Scene:

Racing down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin, GRIPHOOK, clambers out.



Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}



The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.



Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?



They continue on through the cavern.



Griphook: Vault 713.

Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?

Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.

Griphook: Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}



Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.

Harry nods.



Scene: Outside in the street, walking.



Harry: I still need...a wand.

Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.



Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands, but no people.



Harry: {Softly} Hello? Hello?



There is a thunk. A man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. He smiles.



Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave.

Harry: Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}

Ollivander: Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.

Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?

Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}

Harry: And...who owned that wand?

Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}



There is a knock on the window.



Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}

Harry: Wow.



Scene: Later, eating supper. The two, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup.



Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.

Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.

Hagrid: {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...

Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?

Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.

Harry: Voldemort?

Hagrid: Shh!!

{Harry looks around}



A flashback ensues, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.



Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?

Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.

Harry: What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?

Hagrid: Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.





Scene: London Train Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry (with cart and owl) walk beside Hagrid.



A couple look at Hagrid.



Hagrid: What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.



Harry looks at his golden ticket.



Harry: Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}



Scene: Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.



Man: Sorry.

Harry sees a train master.

Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.

Trainmaster: {talking to woman and child} Right on your left, ma'am.

Harry: Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?

Trainmaster: 9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya? {Leaves}



A woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.



Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.

Harry: Muggles?

Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.



A tall boy with red hair comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.



Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.

George: He's not Fred, I am!

Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!

Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.

Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}



Harry shakes his head in disbelief.



Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to

Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.

Ginny (daughter): Good luck.



Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station with a red train and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.



Scene: The train is traveling through unknown country. Pan to inside compartment, where Harry is sitting. The red headed boy, RON, appears, dirt on his nose.



Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.

Harry: No, not at all.

Ron: {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

{Ron goes agape.}

Ron: So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...

Harry: The what?

Ron: {whispers} Scar...?

Harry: Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}

Ron: Wicked.

A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.

Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?

Ron: {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}

Harry: {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!

Ron: Whoa!



Scene: Eating bundles of sweets.

Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over its head.



Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?

Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!



Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.



Harry: {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?

Ron: It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.

Frog: Ribbit. {The frog jumps onto the window and climbs up, then leaps out the window...disappearing.}

Ron: Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.

Harry: Hey, I got Dumbledore!

Ron: I got about 6 of him.

Harry: Hey, he's gone!

Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?

Harry: Just a little bit.

Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?

Harry: Yeah!

Ron: {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-



A girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with bushy brown hair appears at the doorway.



Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.

Ron: No.

Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.

Ron: Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!

{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}

Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?

Ron: {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.

Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}



Scene: Darkness, the train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People begin pouring out of the train.



Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!



Harry and Ron walk up to Hagrid.



Hagrid: Hello, Harry.

Harry: Hey, Hagrid.

Ron: Whoaa!

Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.



Scene:

A number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle can be seen. People are in awe.

Ron: Wicked.



Scene: On a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She raps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.



McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup



NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a scared looking boy, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.



Neville: Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}

McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}



DRACO MALFOY, a slicked back evil looking boy speaks up.



Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}

Harry: I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.



Draco glares. McGonagall returns and smacks him on the shoulder with a paper. He retreats with one last glare.



McGonagall: We're ready for you now.



She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with many kids, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.



Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.

McGonagall: All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.



Dumbledore rises from the main table.



Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.

McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.

Hermione: Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}

Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.

Harry nods in agreement.

Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!

(Cheering)



Hermione jumps off with a smile.



McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.



Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Dracos head.



Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!



Ron: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.

McGonagall: Susan Bones.



A small, redhead goes up.

Harry looks around and spots a black haired, pale teacher, SEVERUS SNAPE, looking at him. His scar hurts.



Harry: Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}

Ron: Harry, what is it?

Harry: Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.



Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!

McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.



Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.



Sorting Hat: Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!

Ron: {Sighs}

(Cheering)



McGonagall: Harry Potter.



Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down.



Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?

Harry: {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin} Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!



There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.

Fred and George are also there, and cheer: We got Potter! We got Potter! Harry sits down.



McGonagall: {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.

Dumbledore: Let the feast...begin.



Food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.



Harry: Wow.



Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in.

Ron stuffs his face.



SEAMUS FINNIGAN, a tiny boy, speaks.



Seamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.

Neville laughs.



Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.



Harry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.

Harry: What's he teach?

Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.



Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghostly head, SIR NICHOLAS, pops out.



Ron: Ahh!

Nick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.



Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.



Hufflepuff ghost: Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Girl: Look, its the Bloody Baron!

Percy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?

Nick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}

Ron: Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!

Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.

Hermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?

Nick: Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}

Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: Eugh.



Scene:

Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircases.



Percy: Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.

Boy: Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

Percy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.



The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.



Percy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}

Neville: Seamus, that picture's moving!

Ron: Look at that one, Harry!

Harry: I think she fancies you.

Girl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?

Man in painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.

Girl: Who's that?



Scene:

Approaching the Gryffindor dorms. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress.



Woman: Password?
Percy: Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.

Girl: Oh, wow.

Percy: {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.



Scene: Mid-night. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with his owl, Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content.





Scene: Morning. Harry and Ron are running through the stone halls to their class. They rush in. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk.



Ron: Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?



The cat jumps off the desk and turns into Professor McGonagall. The two boys are amazed.



Ron: That was bloody brilliant.

McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.

Harry: We got lost.

McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.



Scene: Snape's potions class. The students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.



Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.



Hermione nudges Harry in the ribs. He looks up.



Snape: Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?



Scene: In the great hall, probably midday. The students are all working on homework.



Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.



Seamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...

Harry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?

Ron: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...



ZAPOOF! The cup explodes. There is laughter amongst the students. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.



Ron: Ah. Mail's here!



The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.



Harry: Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.



Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear ball with gold around it.



Seamus: Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!

Hermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.

Neville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.

Harry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.



Scene: Outside, flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, MADAM HOOCH, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.



Hooch: Good afternoon, class.

Class: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

Hooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!

Class: Up!



Harry's broom flies into his hand.



Harry: Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}

Draco: Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}

Hooch: With feeling!

Hermione: Up. Up. Up. Up.

Ron: Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}

Hooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}



Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.



Neville: Oh...

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom.

Girl: Neville, what are you doing?

Students: Neville...Neville...

Boy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.

Hooch: {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: AHH!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!

Harry: Neville! {shouting}

Neville: Help!!!

Hooch: Come back down this instant!

Neville: AHH!



He soars through the sky and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch holds out her wand to stop him.



Neville: Help!

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}

Neville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!

Hooch: Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.

Girl: Is he alright?

Neville: Owowowow.

Hooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}

Draco: {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}

Harry: Give it here, Malfoy.

Draco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?



Harry grabs his broom and runs to get on it. Hermione stops him.



Hermione: Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.



Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.



Harry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!

Draco: Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}



Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working/watching, he catches it, and then heads back to the group. The students all cheer and run to see him.



Boy: Good job, Harry!

Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.

McGonagall: {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}



Scene: Professor Quirrells classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.



Quirrell: An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry: You wait here.} an essential in-gredient

McGonagall: Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

Quirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}

McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!



Scene: Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.



Nick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.

Ron: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in

Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.



Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.



Fred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!

Ron: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.

George: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.

Fred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard. 

George: But they'll turn up in a month or two!!

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}

Harry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?

Hermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.



Scene: The three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.



Ron: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.

Harry: I-I didn't know.





Scene: The three are walking up a staircase. A railing pulls in...Hermione looks, but continues walking.



Ron: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.

Harry: Who doesn't?



The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.



Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: {Gasps.}

Harry: What's happening?

Hermione: The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}

Harry: {taps Ron} Let's go this way.

Ron: Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}

Harry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?

Hermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.



Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, the caretaker's cat, MRS. NORRIS, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.



Harry: Let's go.

{meow}

Ron: It's Filch's cat!

Harry: Run!



The group runs. Flames are lit as they go. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door. Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.



Harry: It's locked!

Ron: That's it, we're done for!

Hermione: Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}

Ron: Alohomora?

Hermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.



Filch appears at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.



Filch: Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}

Hermione: Filch is gone.

Ron: Probably thinks this door's locked.

Hermione: It was locked.

Harry: And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}

All: AHHHHHHH! {The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.}



Scene:

Back in the Gryffindor room. They are breathless.



Ron: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.

Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?

Ron: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}

Hermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.

Harry: Guarding something?

Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}

Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities!

Harry nods.



Scene: Outside, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.



Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?

Harry: {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}

Oliver: ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}

Harry: I like this ball.

Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

Harry: What do I do with it?

Oliver: You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.

{The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.}

Harry: Whoa.



Scene: PROFESSOR FLITWICK's class. The teacher is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books.



Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.

Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.

{All practice.}

Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}

Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

Ron: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.



Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.



Hermione: {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}

Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!



Seamus begins swishing at his feather.



Seamus: Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: Well done, dear.}



BOOOM!!! Seamus' feather explodes. Flitwick gasps.



Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.

Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.



Scene: Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.



Ron: It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!



Hermione bustles past, sniffling.



Harry: I think she heard you.



Scene: Night, in the great hall. It is Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack O'Lanterns are keeping the place lit. There is chatter.



Harry: Where's Hermione?

Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.

{Ron and Harry exchange glances. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes flying into the room, screaming.}

Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}



The room is silent, and then everyone freaks, screaming and running.



Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.

Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!

Boy: Stay together!



Snape looks aghast, and he disappears through a doorway.



Scene: Percy is leading the house down a hall.



Percy: Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!

Harry: How could a troll get in?

Ron: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?

Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!



The two run off, down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise. Harry pulls Ron into a doorway and a large, ugly TROLL thunks by into a room.



Harry: He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!



Scene: In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.



Harry: Hermione, move!



The troll smashes the remaining stalls.



Hermione: Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}

Ron: Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}

Hermione: Ahhh! Help!



Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.



Harry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}

Ron: Ew.



The troll snorts, and whips around.



Harry: Whoa, whoa whoa!



The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down. It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.



Harry: Do something! {swipe}

Ron: What? {swipe}

Harry: Anything! Hurry up!



Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.



Hermione: Swish and flick!

Ron: Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.) It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.



Hermione approaches carefully.



Hermione: Is it...dead?

Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.



Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in.

They all gasp.



McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!

Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...

Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}

McGonagall: Ms. Granger?

Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.

McGonagall: Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}

Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....



Scene: The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.



Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.

Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.

Harry: I'm not hungry.



Snape appears.



Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}

Harry: That explains the blood.

Hermione: Blood?

Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.

Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?

Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.

Hermione: So you're saying...

Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.

{An owl screeches. It is Hedwig. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off.}

Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?

Harry: But I-I never get mail.

Ron: Let's open it.

{They open it.}

Harry: It's a broomstick!
Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!

Harry: But who...?

{He sees Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.}



Scene: Inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.



OIiver: Scared, Harry?

Harry: A little bit.

Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.

Harry: What happened?
Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.



Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. The commentator, LEE JORDAN, is talking from a tower.



Lee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!



{Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering. Neville: Gryffindor!}



The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.



Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.

Hooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}

Lee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.



The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.



Lee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!



Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, ANGELINA JOHNSON, zooms past Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.



Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}



Harry, in the air, claps.



Harry: Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!



In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.



Hagrid: Well done!

Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.



Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and KATIE BELL pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!



Ron and Seamus: Yay!

Harry: Yes!

Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}

Gryffindors: Yay!



The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.



Flint: Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}



Crowd: {Booing}

Harry is visibly upset.

Slytherin laughs.



The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.



Flint: {to other members} Take that side!



They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then his broom starts bucking and turning.



Harry: Whoa! Whooa!

Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?



Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is muttering something.



Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!

Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?

Hermione: Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}



Harry is knocked around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.



Ron: Come on, Hermione!



Hermione is hurrying up a tower. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.



Hermione: Lacarnum Inflamarae.



A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione leaves.



Man: Fire! You're on fire!

Snape: What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}



Ron: Go!

Hagrid: Go go go!



Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches.



The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.



Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!



Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.



Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!

Hooch: {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!

All: YAY!

Draco: No!

Hagrid: Yes!

Hermione: Whoo-hoo!

McGonagall: {Giggles happily}



Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.



Crowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!






Scene:
Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.



Hagrid: Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?

Harry: Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?

Hagrid: Who told you 'bout Fluffy?

Ron: Fluffy?
Hermione: That thing has a name?

Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the

Harry: Yes?

Hagrid: Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.

Harry: But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!

Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.

Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.

Harry: Exactly.

Hagrid: {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

Harry: Nicholas Flamel?

Hagrid: I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}

Harry: Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?

Hermione: I don't know.



Scene: Christmas. The camera pans up to a snowy castle, then to Hagrid, who is bringing in a large tree. Inside the great hall, students are leaving and ghosts are singing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, ring the Hogwarts bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables, wheeling a cart. She goes to Ron and Harry, who are playing chess.



Harry: Knight to E-5.



A piece moves across the board.



Ron thinks for a moment.



Ron: Queen to E-5.



A queen walks over to E-5 and clinks the knight away.



Hermione: That's totally barbaric!

Ron: That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.

Hermione: See you haven't.

Ron: Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!

Hermione: Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.

Ron: We've looked a hundred times!

Hermione: Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}

Ron: I think we've had a bad influence on her.



Scene:

X-mas morning. Hedwig is perched in the boys' room, and Harry is asleep in bed.



Ron: {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!



Harry gets up and runs to a balcony overlooking the common room, where Ron is standing next to a tree. He is wearing a sweater with an R on it.



Ron: Happy Christmas, Harry.

Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?

Ron: Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!

Harry: I've got presents?

Ron: Yeah!

Harry: Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}

Ron: There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}

Harry: "Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."



Harry opens the present. It is a cloak.



Ron: What is it?

Harry: Some kind of...cloak.

Ron: Well, let's see then. Put it on.



Harry puts the cloak on, and all of him disappears except for his head.



Ron: Whoa!

Harry: My body's gone!

Ron: I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!

Harry: I'm invisible??

Ron: {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.

Harry: {comes over} There was no name. It just said, "Use it well."



Scene:

Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed. Harry appears.



Harry: {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?



Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears.



Man: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!



Harry slams the book shuts and puts it back.



Filchs voice: Who's there?! {Harry whips around, grabbing his cloak. The lamp falls and shatters.} I know you're in there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.} Who is it? Show yourself!



Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He gets into the hall, where Mrs. Norris is. The cat meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.



Quirrell: Severus...I-I thought...

Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.

Quirrell: W-what do you m-mean?

Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.



Filch appears, carrying the broken lamp.



Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.



They all dart off. A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In it, he sees two people appear.



Harry: Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.



Scene:

The boys' room. Harry comes whipping in, invisible.



Harry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!

Ron: Why?

Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!



Scene:

Back in the mirror room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.



Harry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!

Ron: I only see me.

Harry: {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad

Ron: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?

Harry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}



Scene:

Another night. Harry is sitting in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.



Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.

Harry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?

Dumbledore: Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}



Scene:

Daytime. It is all snowy. Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. When she returns, it is spring time.



Scene:

In the library. Harry and Ron are seated, reading. Hermione comes up with a huge book. She thumps it onto the table. Harry jumps.



Hermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

Ron: This is light?

Hermione: {glares} Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"

Ron and Harry: The what?

Hermione: Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."

Ron: Immortal?

Hermione: It means you'll never die.

Ron: I know what it means!

Harry: Shh!

Hermione: "The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!



They all look at each other.



Scene:

Nighttime. Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across the wet ground to Hagrids hut. They knock on the door and it opens.



Harry: Hagrid!

Hagrid: {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}

All 3: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!

{Door reopens.}

Hagrid: Oh.

{They all come into Hagrid's small hut.}

Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.

Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?

Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.

Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!

Harry: What?

Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.

Harry: Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?
Hermione: {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.

Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

{Hermione looks at Ron, who is being sniffed in the face by Fang. Ron shuffles away.} Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}

Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?

Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...

Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?

Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.



The egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.



Hermione: Is that...a dragon?

Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.

Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}

Harry: Norbert?

Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?

Ron: {laughs}

Hagrid: Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.



Norbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.



Hagrid: Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}

Harry: Malfoy.

Hagrid: Oh, dear.



Scene:

The three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.



Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.

Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.

Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?

Ron: It's bad.



They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears.



McGonagall: Good evening.



Malfoy appears smugly beside her.



Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three accused are standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.



McGonagall: Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.

Harry: 50?!

McGonagall: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.



Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.



Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."the four of us."



McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.



Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.



Scene:

Outside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.



Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?



Hagrid: {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.

Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.

Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.

Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.

Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!

Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}

Hagrid: Right. Let's go.



Scene: In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.



Harry: Hagrid, what's that?

Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

Ron: {weakly} Okay.

Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}

Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!

Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}



Scene:

Harry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.



Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.

Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.

Draco: Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.



Scene:

The group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.



Harry: What is it, Fang?



Up ahead, a cloaked figure is crouched over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth.



Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting.



Draco: {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!



Harry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoofbeats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur, FIRENZE. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.



Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.

Harry: {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?

Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.

Harry: But who would choose such a life?

Firenze: Can you think of no one?

Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?

Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?

Harry: The Philosopher's Stone.



Suddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.



Hermione: Harry!

Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}

Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.

{Close up on the dead unicorn.}


Scene:

Gryffindor common room. Right after 'attack.' The group is around the fire. Hermione and Ron are seated, but Harry stands.



Hermione: You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?

Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}

Ron: But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?

Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.

Ron: {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!

Hermione: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?

{The boys shrug.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. {Harry smiles slightly.}



Scene:

Some time later. In the outdoor courtyard. The three are walking.



Hermione: I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?

Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.

Hermione: It's happened before.

Harry: Not like this.

Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.

Harry: I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?

Hagrid: I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.

Harry: The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.

Hagrid: Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, "After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."

Harry: And did he seem interested in Fluffy?

Hagrid: Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."



The three gape.



Hagrid: I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!



Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.



Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!

McGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

Harry: He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.

McGonagall: {shocked} How do you know

Harry: Someone's going to try and steal it.

McGonagall: I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}



Scene:

After exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.



Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.

Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone

{Snape suddenly appears behind them}

Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?

Hermione: Uh...we were just...

Snape: You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}

Hermione: Now what do we do?

Harry: We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.



Scene: Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.



Harry: Trevor.

Ron: Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!

Neville: {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?

Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were

Neville: No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}

Hermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.



Neville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.



Ron: {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.

Harry: Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.

Hermione: Sorry.

Ron: It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}



Scene: The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.



Hermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!

Ron: Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}

Hermione: Alohomora.



The door opens and they go in.



Ron: Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.

Harry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}

Ron: Uh. It's got horrible breath!

Harry: We have to move its paw.

Ron: What?!

Harry: Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?

Hermione: The harp. It stopped playing.



Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.



Ron: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}

Harry: Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}

Ron: Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.

Harry: Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}

Hermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.

Ron: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!



Hermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.



Ron and Harry: Hermione!!

Ron: Now what are we gonna do?!

Hermione's voice: Just relax!

Harry: Hermione! Where are you?!

Hermione (from below): Do what I say. Trust me.



Harry relaxes and is sucked through.



Ron: Ahh! Harry!



Harry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.



Ron: Harry!

Hermione: Are you okay?

Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

Ron: Help!

Hermione: He's not relaxing, is he?

Harry: Apparently not.

Ron: Help! Help me!

Hermione: We've got to do something!

Harry: What?

Hermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}

Ron: Ahhh!

Harry: Ron, are you okay?

Ron: Yeah.

Harry: Okay.

Ron: {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!

Harry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.



There is a sound.



Hermione: What is that?

Harry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.



They enter into a room filled with golden "birds."



Hermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.

Harry: They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}

Hermione: What's this all about?

Harry: I don't know. Strange.

{Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.}

Ron: {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.

Hermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!

Ron: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.

Harry: There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}

Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?

Harry: It's too simple.

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!



Harry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.



Ron: This complicates things a bit!



Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.



Harry: Catch the key!



He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.



Ron: Hurry up!



The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.



Scene:

They enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.



Hermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.

Harry: Where are we? A graveyard.

Ron: This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}

Harry: There's the door.



They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.



Hermione: Now what do we do?

Ron: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}

Hermione: What happens now?

Ron: {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}

Hermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?

Ron: You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!



The game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!

Ron: Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.



Harry: Wait a minute.

Ron: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.

Harry: No, Ron! No!

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!

Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!

Ron: {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.



Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.



Ron: Check.



The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.



Ron: Ahhhh!

Harry: RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.

Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.

Harry: Not as good as you.

Hermione: {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.



Harry nods and stands, walking away.





Scene:

Harry walks down a long staircase to an empty room with pillars around it. The Mirror of Erised is in the middle of the room, and a man is standing before it. It is Quirrell. Harry yelps and grabs his scar.



Harry: You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one

Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, "p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"

Harry: B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.

Quirrell: No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.

Harry: Snape was trying to...save me?

Quirrell: I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.

Harry: Th-then you let the troll in.

Quirrell: Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?

{A raspy voice, VOLDEMORT, calls.}: Use the boy.

Quirrell: Come here, Potter, now!



Harry walks forward shakily.



Quirrell: Tell me. What do you see?



Harry looks in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror self brings his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone! The mirror self winks and puts the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reaches to his pocket. There is a lump. He gasps.



Quirrell: What is it?! What do you see?!

Harry: I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.

Voldemort's voice: He lies.

Quirrell: Tell the truth! What do you see?!

Voldemort's voice: Let me speak to him.

Quirrell: Master, you are not strong enough.

Voldemort's voice: I have strength enough for this. {Quirrell unwraps his turban and on the side opposite his face, another face is planted. It is Voldemort who appears kind of like a snake. He stretches out and faces Harry via the mirror.} Harry Potter. We meet again.

Harry: Voldemort.

Voldemort: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!



Harry turns and runs.



Voldemort: Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!

Harry: {shakes his head} Never!

Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}

Harry: You liar!

Voldemort: Kill him!



Quirrell soars into the air and smashes into Harry, one hand on Harrys throat. They fall to the steps. The stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's, trying to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand.



Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}

Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!

Quirrell: {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!



Quirrell backs up, then his face, which is horrendously burned, crumbles as he walks forward. His whole body is ash. He falls to the floor. Harry gasps. He looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs, when he hears something. Turning, Harry sees a dust clouds with Voldemort's face. The cloud rushes forward, right through Harry!



Voldemort: Arrrhhhhhh!

Harry: Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}



Scene:

The hospital wing. Harry is bandaged, lying in bed. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.



Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?

Harry: Admirers?

Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.

Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?

Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.

Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?

Dumbledore: {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.

Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...

Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}

Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?

Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.

Harry: What is it?

Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.



Scene:

Harry approaches a room where up on a stairwell balcony Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.



Harry: All right there, Ron?

Ron: All right? You?

Harry: {shrug} All right. Hermione?

Hermione: {smile} Never better.



Scene:

In the great hall. All students are seated, and green banners with snakes on them are around the ceiling.

Dumbledore, at the head table, nods to McGonagall.

She dings her glass and the chatter stops. Dumbledore rises.



Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.



There is immense cheering.



Students: Whoo! Yeah!

Draco: Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}

Dumbledore: Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}

Harry: {Pats} Good job.

Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}

Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!

Dumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.



Immense cheering erupts. Neville is unbelieving, and sits there while cheering gets louder. Draco is downfallen.



Dumbledore: Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!



Cheering.



Hagrid: Yes! {grins}



All students stand and throw their hats into the air, except Draco, who smashes his down onto the table.



Seamus: Neville! {Shakes his hand.}



All rub each other's hair and jump around, cheering and laughing.



Lee: Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}



Scene:

The outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.



Hagrid: Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.



Harry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.



Hermione: Come on, Harry.

Harry: One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}

Hagrid: Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.



Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.



Harry: Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}

Hagrid: Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.

Harry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.

Hagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.



Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.



Hermione: Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

Harry: I'm not going home. Not really.



The train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin.

CHAPTER 2




3 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 3

Harry pages through a SCRAPBOOK, stops on a MOVING PHOTO
of Ron and Hermione. SQUAWK! Harry jumps. HEDWIG pecks
at the LOCK slung through her cage door, then glowers at
Harry.

HARRY

I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed
to use magic outside of school.
Besides, if Uncle Vernon --
At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.

UNCLE VERNON (O.S.)

Har-ry Pot-ter!

HARRY

Now you've done it.




4 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 4

While AUNT PETUNIA puts the finishing touches to a
PUDDING of WHIPPED CREAM and SUGARED VIOLETS, UNCLE
VERNON struggles with DUDLEY'S BOW TIE, all the while
glowering at Harry.

UNCLE VERNON

I warned you. If you can't
control that bloody bird, it'll
have to go.

HARRY

She's bored. If I could just let
her out for an hour or two --

UNCLE VERNON

And have you sending secret
messages to your freaky little
friends? No, sir.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 2.




4 CONTINUED: 4





HARRY

But I haven't gotten any messages.
From any of my friends. Not one.
All summer.




DUDLEY

Who'd want to be friends with you?

UNCLE VERNON

I should think you'd be more
grateful. We raise you since you
were a baby, give you food off our
table, even let you have Dudley's
second bedroom... purely out of
the goodness of our hearts.

DUDLEY

I thought he got the second
bedroom because Mum was afraid
he'd turn us into dung beetles if
you put him back in the cupboard
under the stairs.
AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle
Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for the
pudding.

AUNT PETUNIA

Not yet, popkin. That's for when
the Masons arrive.

UNCLE VERNON

Which should be any moment. Now.
Let's run through our schedule one
more time. Petunia, when the
Masons get here, you will be --

AUNT PETUNIA

In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

UNCLE VERNON

Good. And Dudley?

DUDLEY

I'll be waiting to open the door.

UNCLE VERNON

Excellent.
(turning on Harry)
And you?

HARRY

I'll be in my bedroom, making no
noise and pretending I don't
exist.




UNCLE VERNON

Too right you will. With any
luck, this could well be the day I
make the biggest deal of my
career.
DOORBELL RINGS. Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry out
of the kitchen and into the hallway.

UNCLE VERNON

Upstairs! Hurry!

6 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 6

Harry enters, turns, and stops dead: a tiny CREATURE
with bat-like ears and bulging green eyes is jumping on
his bed as if it were a trampoline. This is DOBBY.

DOBBY

Harry Potter! Such an honor it
is!

(CONTINUED)

6 CONTINUED: 6





HARRY

What... Who are you?

DOBBY

Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf.

HARRY

I see. Not to be rude or
anything, but this isn't a great
time for me to have a house-elf in
my bedroom.

DOBBY

Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands.
It's just that, Dobby has come to
tell you... it is difficult, sir...
Dobby wonders where to begin.

HARRY

Why don't you sit down?

DOBBY

S-s-sit down?
Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS. LOUD TEARS. Harry
panics.

HARRY

Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything --

DOBBY

Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of
your greatness, sir, but never has
he been asked to sit down by a
wizard, like an equal...

HARRY

You can't have met many decent
wizards then.
Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off the
bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.

DOBBY

Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!




7 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 7

Uncle Vernon pours champagne for MR. and MRS. MASON. As
Dobby's HEAD BANGING sounds from above, all eyes shift to
the ceiling. Uncle Vernon chuckles nervously.

UNCLE VERNON

Don't mind that. It's just the...
cat.




DUDLEY

Cat? What cat?

UNCLE VERNON

Our cat, tiger.




8 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 8

Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning
dizzily. Harry regards him with a mixture of concern...
and wariness.

HARRY

Are you... all right?

DOBBY

Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby almost spoke ill of his
family, sir.

HARRY

Your... family?

DOBBY

The wizard family Dobby serves,
sir. Dobby is bound to serve one
family forever. If they ever knew
Dobby was here...
Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.

DOBBY

But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn
him.
(in a fierce whisper)
Harry Potter must not go back to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry this year.

HARRY

Not go back? But... I have to.

DOBBY

This is a plot. A plot to make
most terrible things happen. If
Harry Potter goes back to school
he will be in great danger.

(CONTINUED)

8 CONTINUED: 8





HARRY

What terrible things? Who's
plotting them?



Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and GAGGING noise.

HARRY

Okay! I understand. You can't
say --
Too late. Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts
beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY.




9 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 9

Uncle Vernon is in the midst of telling a joke.

UNCLE VERNON

They arrive at the ninth hole
and --
DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing out from above.

MR. MASON

Sounds as if that cat of yours has
dragged something in with it,
Dursley.

UNCLE VERNON

Not to worry. I'll sort it out.




10 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY 10

Harry wrestles the lamp away from Dobby.

HARRY

Stop! Stop!
FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grabs
Dobby by the pillowcase and pitches him into the
wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.

UNCLE VERNON

What the devil are you doing up
here! You've just ruined the
punch line of my Japanese golfer
joke. One more sound and you'll
wish you'd never been born, boy!
He stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR.
Harry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe.

(CONTINUED)

10 CONTINUED: 10





HARRY

See why I've got to go back? I
don't belong here. I belong in
your world -- at Hogwarts. It's
the only place I've got...
friends.

DOBBY

Friends who don't even write to
Harry Potter?

HARRY

Well, I expect they've been --
hang on, how do you know my
friends haven't been writing me?
Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.

DOBBY

Harry Potter mustn't be angry with
Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry
Potter thought his friends had
forgotten him... Harry Potter
might not want to go back to
school, sir...

HARRY

Give me those. Now.
Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door.
Panicking...




11 INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS/KITCHEN - DAY 11

... Harry flies desperately after, Dobby bouncing like a
ping-pong ball down the stairs and into the kitchen. As
Harry races in, he finds Dobby on the counter, waving his
arms. Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding RISES,
then floats into the living room, HOVERING over the
Mason's heads. The Masons don't see, but the Dursleys --
goggle-eyed--do.

HARRY

Dobby... Please... No...

DOBBY

Harry Potter must say he's not
going back to school.

HARRY

I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

DOBBY

(a tragic
expression)
Then Dobby must do it, sir. For
Harry Potter's own good.
Dobby SNAPS HIS FINGERS. The pudding PLUMMETS...
straight onto the Masons. They stand blinking, covered
head to foot with whipped cream and sugared violets. The
Masons exit. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia race after
them.

UNCLE VERNON

I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very
disturbed. Meeting strangers
upsets him, so we kept him
upstairs...




11A EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - DAY 11A

The Masons RACE out of the house, the Dursleys FOLLOWING.

AUNT PETUNIA

We have ice cream...
The Masons get into their car and drive off, just as a
SHRIEKING SOUND splits the sky. An OWL SWOOPS down, and
DROPS a LETTER at Uncle Vernon's feet. He picks up the
letter, opens it. As he reads it, a mad gleam dances in
Uncle Vernon's eye. He turns and races back inside the
house. Aunt Petunia follows.




11B INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 11B

Uncle Vernon runs back into the living room, extends the
letter to Harry.

UNCLE VERNON

Go on. Read it.

HARRY

'Dear Mr. Potter. We have
received intelligence that a Hover
Charm was used at your place of
residence at twelve minutes past
seven this evening. As you know,
underage wizards...'

UNCLE VERNON

back to that school! Never!




12 EXT./INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY 12


A SHORT MONTAGE BEGINS:

Uncle Vernon fits IRON BARS to the inside of Harry's
window.
Drills a METAL FLAP to the base of the bedroom door.
Fits a FAT, GREY LOCK to the door itself. Soaking with
sweat, he casts Harry a nasty grin and pulls shut the
DOOR. It closes with the DULL CLANK of a cell.




13 INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

Harry stares gloomily out the window. The METAL FLAP
RATTLES and Dudley's pudgy hand slides a BOWL of TINNED
SOUP onto the floor. He grins cruelly through the
opening.

DUDLEY

I know what day it is.

HARRY

Well done, Dudley. Finally
learned the days of the week, have
you.

DUDLEY

Today's your birthday. And nobody
cares.
Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap. Harry sighs, takes the soup
and a bit of stale bread, and crosses to Hedwig.

HARRY

It's no good turning your beak up.
It's all we've got.
Harry feeds a piece of bread to Hedwig... as we...

Harry leans against the wall. Asleep. There is a gentle
TAPPING SOUND. Harry opens his eyes and is stunned to
see... RON WEASLEY staring through the bedroom window.

HARRY

Ron?

RON

Hiya, Harry.




13A EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 13A

An OLD, TURQUOISE-COLORED FORD ANGLIA floats in midair.
Ron leans out the back window. His brother FRED sits in
the driver's seat. Fred's twin George is in the
passenger seat.

HARRY

Fred? George? What're you doing
here?

RON

Rescuing you, of course. Where's
your trunk?




13B CLOSEUP - HARRY'S TRUNK 13B

Stuffed with clothes, spellbooks. The trunk CLOSES, SNAPS
SHUT. Harry drags the trunk to the windowsill, watches Ron
tie off a fierce knot on the bars of Harry's window.

RON

Stand back.
Harry steps back. Ron turns, nods to Fred.




13C INSERT - FRED'S FOOT 13C

Fred STEPS ON the accelerator.




13D EXT. DURSLEY HOUSE - NIGHT 13D

The Ford Anglia FLIES UP into the air, the rope SNAPS
TIGHT, and -- CRUNCH! -- the bars are TORN from the
window. Bricks and bars RAIN DOWN onto the lawn below, a
mangled mess.

Harry pushes the trunk over the sill into the Anglia's
boot, then scrambles through the window himself, when...

SQUAWK!


HARRY

Hedwig!
Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto
the ledge, when... BAM! The bedroom door CRASHES OPEN.




UNCLE VERNON

Petunia! He's getting away!
As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES
FORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle. Harry tumbles into the
darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other
reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possible
second.
Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls
harder. Ron braces himself, pulls back. Harry hangs,
stretched high over the lawn, directly above the mangled
steel bars.
CLOSEUP: Harry's hand begins to slip from Ron's fingers.
INSIDE OF CAGE: Hedwig PECKS feverishly at the LOCK.
CLOSE-UP: Ron. PANICKED.

RON

Hold on, Harry!

UNCLE VERNON

Oh no, boy! You and that bloody
pigeon aren't going anywhere!
CLOSE-UP: Harry's hand begins to slip away from Ron's.
INSIDE OF CAGE: Hedwig PECKS HARDER and... the CAGE

Hedwig SWOOPS into the sky, WHEELS BACK and hammers her
beak into Uncle Vernon's hand. He ROARS, stumbles back

Birthday.

18 EXT. THE BURROW - EARLY MORNING 18

As the Anglia drops through a pink sky, a haphazard mess
of a HOUSE, built around a towering central chimney,
appears below. By the road, a lopsided SIGN reads: THE
BURROW. FLUMPH! The car touches down in a WHIRLING CONE
of dust, scatters a group of chickens, and fishtails to a
halt. The boys spill quickly out of the car. FRED
WHISPERS urgently.

FRED

Hurry! Let's nip inside before
Mum wakes up!




19 INT. FRONT ROOM - THE BURROW - MOMENTS LATER 19

The boys sneak inside, gently close the door. Harry
stops. Magical objects surround him: A CLOCK displays
different chores for each family member. A pair of
NEEDLES knit a sweater by themselves. And a stack of
PLAYING CARDS that. A stack of PLAYING CARDS SHUFFLE
themselves, providing a cooling breeze for Ron's aging
rat, SCABBERS. Ron shrugs, averts his eyes self-
consciously.

RON

It's not much.

HARRY

I think it's... brilliant!
Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face. Slowly...

MRS. WEASLEY

Harry! How wonderful to see you.
(back to the boys)
Beds empty! No note! You
could've died! You could've been
seen!
(again, to Harry)
I don't blame you, of course,
dear.

RON

They were starving him, Mum!
There were bars on his window!

MRS. WEASLEY

You best hope I don't put bars on
your window, Ronald Weasley!
(softening instantly)
Care for a spot of tea, Harry?

GINNY

Mummy. Have you seen my jumper --
A small, RED-HEADED GIRL appears. Sees Harry. And...
SQUEALS. Dashes back up the stairs. Ron frowns.

RON

Ginny. Been talking about you all
summer. Dead annoying, really.

GEORGE

Dad's home!
The front door OPENS and ARTHUR WEASLEY enters. A tall
man with red hair, his robes look dusty and travel-worn.

MR. WEASLEY

What a night! Nine raids! Nine!

HARRY

(to Ron)
Raids?

RON

Dad works at the Ministry of
Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle
Artefacts Office.

HARRY

The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?

RON

That's when wizards bewitch
something to drive Muggles mad.
Shrinking door keys, that kind of
thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks
they're fascinating.
Mr. Weasley hangs up his cloak, turns. Blinks.

MR. WEASLEY

Well now. Who are you?

RON

Harry, sir. Harry Potter.

MR. WEASLEY

Good Lord, are you really? Ron's
told us all about you, of course.
When did you get here?

MRS. WEASLEY

(darkly)
This morning. Your sons flew that
enchanted car of yours to Surrey
house and back last night.

MR. WEASLEY

Did you now! How'd it go?!
(catching his
wife's eye)
I... I mean... That was very
wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed.
So, Harry. You must know all
about Muggles. Tell me, what
exactly is the function of a
parking meter?
Harry is about to answer, when he notices an OWL (ERROL)
soaring toward the kitchen window. To Harry's horror,
the owl doesn't pull up. It just flies... SMACK!... into
the glass.

MRS. WEASLEY

That must be Errol with the post.
Fetch him, will you, George?
George takes the unconscious Errol, absently lays him on
a draining board, and takes the LETTERS clutched in his
claws.

GEORGE

It's our Hogwarts letters! And
look. They've sent Harry's as well.

Dumbledore must know you're here,

man.




FRED

This lot won't come cheap, Mum.
The spellbooks alone...

MRS. WEASLEY

We'll manage. Right then.
There's only one place to get all
of this.

HARRY/RON/FRED/GEORGE

Diagon Alley!

24 INT. LIVING ROOM - THE BURROW - DAY (LATER) 24

Everyone has gathered in front of the large fireplace.

MRS. WEASLEY

You first, Harry dear.
Mrs. Weasley offers Harry a FLOWERPOT. At the bottom is
a layer of VERY SOFT DUST. Harry frowns in confusion.

RON

Harry's never traveled by Floo
Powder before, Mum.

HARRY

Floo Powder?
Just then, Ron's older brother PERCY enters.

MRS. WEASLEY

Percy. Would you mind going
first, so Harry can see how it's
done?

PERCY

Certainly, Mother. Don't worry,
Harry. It's simple enough.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 16.

Percy takes a pinch from the pot, pitches it into the
fireplace and BRIGHT GREEN FLAMES ROAR HIGH. To Harry's
amazement, he calmly walks... straight into them.




PERCY

Diagon Alley.
Percy VANISHES. Tentatively, Harry reaches into the pot.

MRS. WEASLEY

Remember to speak clearly, dear!

RON

And mind you get out at the right grate!

HARRY

(nodding, unsure)
D-Dia-gon Alley!




25 INT. SPIRALING TUNNEL 25

The SOUND is DEAFENING as Harry hurtles forward,
squinting against the sting of WHIRLING SOOT and the mad,
flickering lights of passing fireplaces. He falls face
forward...




26 INT. BORGIN AND BURKES - STONE FIREPLACE - DAY 26

... onto a stone hearth. Dizzy and dirty, Harry reclaims
his shattered glasses. He's tumbled into a wizard's
shop, but a decidedly creepy one. He starts to exit,
when a WITHERED HAND in a GLASS CASE catches his eye:
The Hand of Glory. Nearby, an OPAL NECKLACE gleams:
Caution: Do not touch. Cursed--Has Claimed the Lives of
Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. Oddly transfixed by it
all, Harry drifts toward the exit, when...

(CONTINUED)





17.





26 CONTINUED: 26




DRACO MALFOY and his father, LUCIUS MALFOY, appear beyond
the front window, approaching the shop. Harry glances
about, spies a LARGE BLACK CABINET and slips inside. As
he pulls the doors closed, a TINY CARD swings INTO VIEW:
Crushing Cabinet.
Malfoy and his father enter. A stooped man (MR. BORGIN)
emerges from the back room. IN THE CABINET, Harry
watches, unaware that the walls around him are... SLOWLY

CLOSING IN.


MR. BORGIN

Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to
see you again. If I may, just in
today --

LUCIUS MALFOY

I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin.
But selling.

MR. BORGIN

Selling?

LUCIUS MALFOY

You have heard, of course, that
the Ministry of Magic is
conducting more raids. There are
even rumors of a new Muggle
Protection Act...
Lucius unravels a roll of parchment, hands it to Borgin.

LUCIUS MALFOY

I have a few... ah... items at
home that might prove embarrassing
if the Ministry were to call.
Certain poisons and the like...

MR. BORGIN

Hmmm... yes. I see...
INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING
IN. His eyes shift upward. The ceiling is DROPPING.
Draco drifts to the Hand of Glory, reaches out, when...
the HAND GRABS HIM. Draco shrieks, manages to slip free,
then calms. He eyes the hand with malicious glee.

DRACO

Can I have this?

(CONTINUED)





18.





26 CONTINUED: (2) 26





MR. BORGIN

Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a
candle and it gives light only to
the holder. Best friend of
thieves and plunderers. Your son
has fine taste, sir.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Hopefully my son will amount to
more than a thief, Mr. Borgin.
Though if his marks don't pick
up --

DRACO

It's not my fault the teachers
have favorites. That Hermione
Granger --

LUCIUS MALFOY

I would have thought you'd be
ashamed that a girl of no
wizarding family beat you in every
exam.

MR. BORGIN

It's the same all over. Wizard
blood is counting for less
everywhere.

LUCIUS MALFOY

(deadly)
Not with me.
INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry's knees are up under his chin...
Borgin checks off one last time, then returns the
parchment to Lucius. Satisfied, Malfoy nods.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Very good. I'll expect you at the
manor tomorrow. Come, Draco.
They exit. As Borgin slips into the back room, the
Crushing Cabinet's doors FLY OPEN and Harry leaps free.
Inside, the walls, floor, and ceiling SNAP SHUT! Borgin
reappears, blinks curiously at Harry, then watches him
RACE out the door.




27 EXT. KNOCKTURN ALLEY - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 27

Once outside, Harry fits his broken glasses to his face,
eyes a STREET SIGN: "KNOCKTURN ALLEY."

(CONTINUED)





19.





27 CONTINUED: 27




The vendors here clearly cater to the Dark Arts:
SHRUNKEN HEADS, POISONOUS CANDLES. One window teems with

SPIDERS.





AGED WITCH (O.S.)

Not lost are you, my dear?
Harry wheels, looking into the mossy teeth of a decrepit
WITCH. She holds a tray of HUMAN FINGERNAILS.

HARRY

I'm fine, thanks. I'm just --

HAGRID

HARRY! What d'yer think yer doin'
down 'ere?

HARRY

Hagrid!
Hagrid knocks the tray from the cursing Witch's hands,
then seizes Harry by the scruff of the neck and steers
him away.




28 EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY 28

Hagrid swats at Harry's sooty clothes.

HAGRID

Yer a mess! Skulkin' 'round
Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place,
Harry. Don't want no one ter see
yeh down there. People'll be
thinkin' yer up ter no good.

HARRY

I was lost, I -- Hang on. What
were you doing down there?

HAGRID

I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin'
Slug Repellent. They're ruinin'
the school cabbages.

HERMIONE (O.S.)

Harry!
Harry looks up, sees HERMIONE GRANGER standing at the top
of Gringotts' white steps. She runs down to meet them.

(CONTINUED)





20.





28 CONTINUED: 28





HERMIONE

Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful
to see you two again.



She stops then, cocks her head curiously at Harry, then
takes out her wand and points it directly between his
eyes.

HERMIONE

Oculus Reparo.
Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.

HARRY

I need to remember that one.

HERMIONE

C'mon. Everyone's been so worried.
Hermione leads them to Gringotts, where Hermione's rather
nervous-looking Muggle parents stand with the Weasleys.

MR. WEASLEY

So you're dentists! Fascinating!
I understand other Muggles quite
fear you? Why is that?

MRS. WEASLEY

Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We
hoped you'd only gone one grate
too far. Come now. We're off to
Flourish and Blotts.

HERMIONE

Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy
Lockhart's going to be there! We
can actually meet him! I mean,
he's written almost the whole
booklist!
As Mrs. Weasley and Hermione dash off, Harry frowns.

HARRY

Who?




29 OMITTED 29





29A EXT. FLOURISH AND BLOTTS - DAY 29A

CLOSE-UP: GILDEROY LOCKHART. A handsome, golden-haired
wizard with stunning pearl-white teeth. He miles, winks
at the camera.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 21.




29A CONTINUED: 29A




DOLLY BACK to reveal that the image of Lockhart is
actually a MOVING PHOTOGRAPH propped in the window. A
PLACARD declares: HERE TODAY! SIGNING COPIES OF HIS

AUTOBIOGRAPHY, MAGICAL ME... GILDEROY LOCKHART!








30 INT. FLOURISH AND BLOTTS - DAY 30

Harry and the others thread their way through a
CHATTERING THRONG of MIDDLE-AGED LADIES, all craning
their necks for a view of Lockhart, who sits signing
books at the rear of the shop. At the sight of him, Mrs.
Weasley pats her hair.

MRS. WEASLEY

There he is!

RON

Mum fancies him.
For this, Mrs. Weasley gives Ron a jab in the shoulder.
A SHORT MAN WITH A CAMERA bumps past.

SHORT MAN

Out of the way! This is for The
Daily Prophet!
Instantly, Lockhart looks up, flashes a smile, when...

GILDEROY LOCKHART

It can't be Harry Potter?
The crowd WHISPERS excitedly as Lockhart dives forward,
seizes Harry's hand and turns him toward the
photographer.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

(under his breath)
Nice big smile, Harry. Together,
you and I rate the front page.
(as the CAMERA FLASHES)
Ladies and gentlemen! What an
extraordinary moment this is!
When young Harry here stepped into
Flourish and Blotts this morning
to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me -- which, incidentally
is celebrating its twenty-seventh
week atop The Daily Prophet's
Bestseller List -- he had no idea
that he would, in fact, be leaving
with my entire collected works!
Free of charge!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 22.




30 CONTINUED: 30




As the crowd CLAPS, Lockhart catches the eye of a FLUNKY
and, before Harry knows it, a towering stack of books is
shoved into his arms. Mortified, Harry mumbles quietly.




HARRY

Thank you.
Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red
with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's
cauldron.

HARRY

You have these. I'll buy my
own --

DRACO

(appearing, sneers)
Bet you loved that, didn't you,
Potter? Famous Harry Potter.
Can't even go into a bookshop
without making the front page.

GINNY

Leave him alone! He didn't want
all that!

DRACO

Look, Potter. You've got yourself
a girlfriend!

(CONTINUED)





23.





30 CONTINUED: (2) 30





LUCIUS MALFOY

Silence, Draco! Ah... Mr. Potter.
I don't believe we've met.



Lucius Malfoy extends his hand, as if offering to shake
Harry's, but instead gently plays his fingers over the
fringe of Harry's scalp, revealing Harry's LIGHTNING BOLT
SCAR. At his touch, Harry withdraws, ever so slightly.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your
scar is legend. As, of course, is
the wizard who gave it to you.

HARRY

He was a murderer.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Yes, a pity about your parents.
Curious that you yourself should
escape with a mere flesh wound.
Curious, too, that you speak of
him in the past. Surely, you
don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named is gone forever.

HARRY

His name is Voldemort.
Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.

LUCIUS MALFOY

You must be very brave, Mr.
Potter, to dare speak his name.
Or foolish.

HERMIONE

Fear of a name only increases fear
of the thing itself.
Lucius Malfoy's eyes slide, find Hermione staring
defiantly.

LUCIUS MALFOY

You must be Miss Granger. Draco's
told me all about you... and your
parents. Muggles, aren't you?
Mr. and Mrs. Granger nod nervously. Lucius Malfoy can
barely disguise his distaste for them. Arthur Weasley
hurries over.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 5/14/02 24.




30 CONTINUED: (3) 30





MR. WEASLEY

Ron! Harry! It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.




LUCIUS MALFOY

Well, well, well -- Arthur
Weasley.

MR. WEASLEY

(stiffly)
Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Busy time at the Ministry. All
those raids. I hope they're
paying you overtime.
Malfoy reaches into Ginny's cauldron, removes a very old,
battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Obviously not. Dear me. What's
the use of being a disgrace to the
name of wizard if they don't even
pay you well for it.

MR. WEASLEY

We have a very different idea
about what disgraces the name of
wizard, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY

(glancing at the
Grangers)
Clearly. The company you keep,
Weasley. And I thought your
family could sink no lower.
Mr. Weasley moves to hit Lucius Malfoy. Hagrid steps
forward, puts a firm hand on Mr. Weasley's shoulder.

HAGRID

Ignore 'im, Arthur.
Mr. Weasley backs away. Lucius Malfoy tosses Ginny's
BATTERED TEXTBOOK back into her cauldron.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Here, girl. Take your book. It's
the best your father can give you.
Lucius and Draco exit. Hagrid looks at the Weasleys.

As Harry watches Draco and his father go, we --

DISSOLVE TO:

30B EXT. KING'S CROSS - MORNING 30B

Amid a neat line of cars, the Anglia sits at a decidedly
odd angle, as if its driver were not the most skilled
motorist.

32 INT. KING'S CROSS - DAY 32

The Weasleys and Harry -- pushing large TROLLEYS -- dash
under the LARGE CLOCK which reads two minutes to eleven.

MRS. WEASLEY

Oh dear! The train'll be leaving
any moment! All together now!
Hurrying, they race to PLATFORMS NINE AND TEN. Quickly,
Percy, Fred and George stride briskly toward the stone
barrier that divides the platforms -- and simply

DISAPPEAR.


MRS. WEASLEY

Go on, Ginny. You know what to
do.
Ginny, looking a bit nervous, rushes toward the barrier,
closes her eyes, and sleds...




32A INT. PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS - DAY 32A

HOGWARTS EXPRESS, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley materialize at her
side.

32B INT. KING'S CROSS 32B

Ron glances at the clock.

RON

We better hurry.
Harry nods, leans into his trolley and -- CRASH! -- hits
the barrier and bounces back into Ron. A GUARD glowers.

GUARD

What in blazes d'you two think
you're doing?

HARRY

Sorry. Lost control of the
trolley.
(to Ron)
Why can't we get through?

RON

I dunno. The gateway's sealed
itself for some reason.
As Ron presses his ear to the barrier, the CLOCK CHIMES.

HARRY

The train leaves at exactly eleven
o'clock. We've missed it.

RON

Can't hear a thing.
(a sudden thought)
Harry. If we can't get through,
maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

HARRY

Maybe we should go wait by the
car.

RON

The car!




33 EXT. PARKING LOT (KING'S CROSS) - MOMENTS LATER 33

Pushing their trolleys madly before them, Harry and Ron
dash to the car, load their belongings into the Anglia's
boot.

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 27.




33 CONTINUED: 33





HARRY

This is mad. We can't drive to
Hogwarts.




RON

Who says we're driving?

HARRY

You don't mean -- Ron, no.

RON

Look, who knows when Mum and Dad
will get back. And we've got to
get to school, haven't we? And
even underage wizards are allowed
to use magic if it's an absolute
emergency. Least that's what Fred
and George always say...

HARRY

Something tells me we're going to
regret this.




33A INT. ANGLIA - DAY 33A

Ron TAPS his WAND on the dash and the Anglia burbles to
life.

HARRY

No offense, Ron, but are you sure
you know how to fly this.

RON

No problem.
Ron SHIFTS. With a GREAT JOLT, the car lifts from the
ground.

RON

There. See. Now I reckon all we
have to do is find the Hogwarts
Express and follow it. Simple.
Harry nods, not entirely convinced. He peers out the
window. Down below, TWO PEDESTRIANS stare in disbelief.

HARRY

Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most
Muggles aren't accustomed to
seeing a flying car.

RON

Right.
Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and
they... DISAPPEAR. Down below, the baffled pedestrians
blink.




28.





34 EXT. FLYING CAR (SCOTLAND) - DAY (LATER) 34




CAMERA STARTS IN the clouds, passes through, finds
Scotland's stunning green. The Anglia's ENGINE PUTTERS
softly, when -- POP! - the car reappears. Ron jabs at
the silver button.




RON

Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.
CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff. The
car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.

RON

Any sign of the train?

HARRY

There! Up ahead! Look...
Along a STEEP BRIDGE, a single line of TRAIN TRACKS
appear.

RON

Brilliant.
Ron SHIFTS, GLIDES DOWN, until the Anglia is only a few
feet above the tracks. The boys peer ahead, looking for
the train.

RON

It must be around here
someplace.
Behind them, through the Anglia's rear window, the
Hogwarts Express APPEARS, closing fast. Harry and Ron
perk up. Smile.

HARRY

Do you hear that?
Then, at precisely the same moment, Harry and Ron
register the DIRECTION of the sound. They glance at each
other, turn as one and see the train GROWING HUGE in the
rear window.

HARRY/RON

Aaaahhhhh!
Ron SPINS THE WHEEL, puts his foot to the gas and -- at
the last possible second -- whips the Anglia out of the
train's path. The car WAFFLES, TOPPLES upside down
briefly, before...

(CONTINUED)





29.





34 CONTINUED: 34




... TILTING onto its side. As it jets under the bridge,
Harry goes SLIDING DOWN ACROSS HIS SEAT, into the door,
and... OUT. Dangling upside-down from the open door, he
watches the Hogwarts Express ZIP PAST and, in one window,
glimpses NEVILLE and SEAMUS, mouths open in astonishment.

RON

Take my hand!
Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far
below. It's quite a drop. Harry's fingers begin to LOSE

THEIR GRIP.


RON

Hold on!

HARRY

I'm trying! Your hand's all
sweaty!
Straining, Ron yanks him inside, levels off the car. As
Harry falls heavily into his seat, he BUCKLES his safety
belt.

HARRY

I think we found the train.




35 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FLYING CAR - NIGHT 35

As HOGWARTS CASTLE comes INTO VIEW, the Anglia ENTERS

FRAME.


RON

Welcome home, Harry.
Harry smiles at the sight of it, when... the Anglia

GROANS.


HARRY

Just out of interest, Ron. Have
you ever landed a car before?

RON

Well... no. but, until a few
hours ago, I'd never taken off in
one either.
With that, the car LURCHES, the nose DROPS, and...

RON

Uh oh.

(CONTINUED)





30.





35 CONTINUED: 35




... Harry, Ron and car go pitching through the night. As
Ron rakes the GEARS, they hurtle madly toward the CASTLE

WALL.





RON


IT'S NOT WORKING!


HARRY


UP! UP!

Ron SHIFTS desperately. The Anglia LURCHES up, barely
clears the castle wall. Harry and Ron exchange a look of
relief, when... the car GROANS again, LURCHES...
downward.

HARRY


MIND THAT TREE!

Down below a GIANT WILLOW TREE looms. Ron SHIFTS.
Nothing.

HARRY


TURN! TURN!

Harry reaches over and, together, he and Ron SPIN THE
WHEEL. It's useless. The car is heading straight for the
tree. Desperately, Ron WHIPS OUT his wand and WHACKS THE

DASHBOARD.


RON


STOP! STOP! STOP!

The wand SNAPS IN TWO and -- CRUNCH! -- car meets tree.
Harry blinks. They hang dreamily, BALANCED on the

HIGHEST LIMB.


RON

My wand! Look at my wand!

HARRY

Be thankful it's not your neck.
THWUNMP! Something HEAVY HITS Harry's door, sends a
SHUDDER through the car.

RON

What's happening?
Slowly, they look up and, in disbelief, watch one of the
tree's branches PULL BACK, CURL INTO ITSELF, and come
LASHING FORWARD like a MASSIVE FIST. THWUMP!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 31.




35 CONTINUED: (2) 35





HARRY/RON

Aaaaahhhhh!
The Anglia tilts crazily, slides backwards and FREE-FALLS
through the air and... LANDS on lower grid of branches.

RON

What kind of tree is this?
Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE
CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like
popcorn. WINDOWS SHATTER. Heavy DENTS appear on the
roof above Ron and Harry's heads. Then the car FALLS
again...
... SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND. Instantly, the
tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear
windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR

BACK AND FORTH.


HARRY/RON

Aaaaahhhhh!
The tree PITCHES the car into the air. As the Anglia
SLAMS DOWN again, bobbing on its SQUEALING SHOCKS, the
ENGINE BURBLES BACK TO LIFE. Harry LOOKS UP, peering
through the shattered windscreen. The willow's branches,
as one, rear back, ready for one last punishing blow.
Harry CRIES OUT.

HARRY

Reverse! Reverse!
Ron SHIFTS, the CAR SHOOTS BACKWARDS, and the willow
PUMMELS THE TREAD-MARKED GROUND they just vacated.
Safely clear, the doors fly open, the seats tip sideways,
and Ron and Harry are ejected. As they hit the ground,
their trunks fly from the boot, Hedwig's cage rockets out
the back window, and Hedwig herself flaps into the night.
Taillights blazing angrily, the BATTERED car speeds off,
fishtailing into the Dark Forest.

RON

Dad's going to kill me.
They hear a TREMENDOUS GROAN, turn back, and see the
Whomping Willow assume its natural form, waiting for its
next victim.

36 EXT. STONE STEPS/ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 36

Filthy and bruised, Harry and Ron drag themselves up the
steps. Behind them we see the mountain of student trunks
and caged pets already brought up from the train.

A house elf shows up in my
bedroom, we can't get through the

Quarters, we almost get killed by
a tree... clearly someone doesn't
want me here this year.

FILCH

Well, take a good look, lads...
They stop. ARGUS FILCH stands at the top of the landing,
his cat -- MRS. NORRIS -- twitching her tail at his feet.

FILCH

This night might well be the last
you spend in this castle.




37 INT. SNAPE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 37

CLOSEUP: The Evening Prophet ENTERS FRAME. The HEADLINE
reads: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. Below the
fold a PHOTO shows Harry and Lockhart at Flourish and

stare with dread. Filch lurks in the doorway, eying them
with pleasure.

SNAPE

You were seen! By no less then
seven Muggles. Do you have any
idea how serious this is? You
have risked the exposure of our
world. Not to mention the damage
you inflicted on a Whomping Willow
that has been on these grounds for
hundreds of years.

RON

Honestly, Professor Snape, I think
it did more damage to us.

SNAPE

Silence! I assure you, were you
in Slytherin and your fate rested
with me, the both of you would be
on the train home tonight. As it
is --

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

They are not.
Harry and Ron turn. ALBUS DUMBLEDORE stands in the
doorway. Alongside him is a distinctly annoyed PROFESSOR
McGONAGALL.

HARRY

Professor Dumbledore. Professor
McGonagall...

SNAPE

Headmaster, these boys have
flouted the Decree for the
Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
As such...

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

I'm well aware of our bylaws,
Severus, having written more than
a few myself. However, as Head of
Gryffindor House, it is for
Professor McGonagall to determine
the appropriate action.

RON

We'll go and get our stuff.

Weasley?

Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I
must impress upon both of you the
seriousness of what you have done.
I will be sending owls to both of
your families tonight. And you
will each get a detention.
Snape casts a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron.

DUMBLEDORE

Splendid. Now, I suggest we
return to the feast. There's a
delicious-looking custard tart I
want to sample.
Rising, Harry spies an ENVELOPE on the floor. Taking it,
he reads the back: "KWIKSPELL. A CORRESPONDENCE COURSE IN
BEGINNER'S MAGIC." It's addressed to "MR. ARGUS FILCH."

HARRY

Mr. Filch. You dropped this...
Filch turns, eyes the envelope with embarrassment, then
snatches it from Harry's hand and stuffs it into his
pocket.

39 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING 39

The Whomping Willow sulks in the courtyard, SLINGS strung
about its injured branches. CAMERA CRANES OVER the
castle walls, REVEALING the exterior of GREENHOUSE THREE,
where students hurry inside for the beginning of class.




40 INT. GREENHOUSE THREE - MORNING 40

As Harry and Ron enter, SEAMUS, NEVILLE and some of the
other Gryffindors hover nearby.

NEVILLE

HERMIONE

I should think you'd count
yourself lucky that's all you got.




RON

I should think you'd mind your own
business.
They glare at each other. PROFESSOR SPROUT, a squat
little witch, TAPS her wand on a stack of POTS.

PROFESSOR SPROUT

Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
Second Years. Today, we will be
re-potting Mandrakes. Now, who
here can tell me the properties of
the Mandrake? Yes, Miss Granger.

HERMIONE

Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used
to return those who have been
transfigured to their original
state. It's also quite dangerous.
The Mandrake's cry is fatal to
anyone who hears it.

PROFESSOR SPROUT

Excellent. Ten points to
Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are
only seedlings, their cries won't
kill yet. However, they will
knock you out for several hours.
That is why I have provided each
of you with a pair of earmuffs.
If you would then...
Ron frowns. He's gotten a BRIGHT PINK FLUFFY pair. When
the class is ready, Professor Sprout leads them to the
GARDEN AREA. She grasps one of the TUFTY PLANTS before
her... and pulls. Harry gasps. Instead of roots, a
small, muddy, extremely ugly BABY pops out of the earth,
leaves growing right out of its head. Neville's eyes
ROLL BACK. He FAINTS.
Professor Sprout plunges the BAWLING CREATURE deep into a
POT, removes her earmuffs, and the others follow suit.
Everyone save Neville, who lies stretched on the ground.

PROFESSOR SPROUT

Hm. Looks as though Mr.
Longbottom neglected his muffs.

Percy enters in the company of PENELOPE CLEARWATER, just
as NEARLY HEADLESS NICK glides by.

PENELOPE CLEARWATER

There's Nearly Headless Nick.

PERCY

Hello, Sir Nicolas.

NEARLY HEADLESS NICK

Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater.
At the Gryffindor table, Hermione has her nose buried in
Gilderoy Lockhart's Travels with Trolls. Ron runs gobs
of Spellotape over his BROKEN WAND, shakes his head
grimly.

RON

Say it. I'm doomed.

HARRY

You're doomed.
FLASH! -- a LIGHT BLINDS Harry. He blinks, finds a small
boy (COLIN CREEVEY) standing before him with a CAMERA.

COLIN

Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey.
I'm in Gryffindor too.

HARRY

Hello, Colin. Nice to meet --

COLIN

They're for my dad -- the
pictures. He's a milkman, you
know, a Muggle, like all our
family's been until me. No one
knew all the odd stuff I could do
was magic till we got my letter
from Hogwarts. Everyone just

Harry glances at Ron. He looks positively homicidal.
Mercifully, just then, OWLS STREAM into the Hall.

DEAN THOMAS

Post is here!
One after another, the birds swoop gracefully down,
clutching letters from home. All except one, who plops
beak-first into Ron's soup. Errol.

Ron looks pale. Clutched in Errol's beak is a DAMP RED

MRS. WEASLEY'S VOICE THUNDERS, sending plates and spoons
rattling.

MRS. WEASLEY (V.O.)

Oh, and Ginny dear.
Congratulations on making
Gryffindor. Your father and I are
so proud.
Ginny, sitting a bit apart from the others, looks up
shyly, then returns to the SMALL BLACK BOOK she's
scribbling in. Ron watches the envelope RIP ITSELF TO
PIECES, then endures HOWLS of LAUGHTER from the other
House tables. Colin Creevey snaps a few photos. Harry
looks sympathetically at Ron.

HARRY

Look at it this way. How much
worse can things get?

42 INT. GILDEROY LOCKHART'S CLASSROOM - DAY 42




Gilderoy Lockhart paces before the class. Hermione and
the girls hang on his every word, while Harry and Ron eye
the LARGE, COVERED CAGE RATTLING mysteriously on his desk.




GILDEROY LOCKHART

Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts
Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart,
Order of Merlin, Third Class,
Honorary Member of the Dark Force
Defense League and five times
winner of Witch Weekly's Most-
Charming-Smile Award -- But I
don't talk about that. I didn't
get rid of the Bandon Banshee by
smiling at her!
Lockhart awaits laughter. A few students smile weakly.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

I see you've all bought a complete
set of my books. Well done. I
thought we'd start today with a
little quiz. Nothing to worry
about. Just to check how well
you've read them, how much you've
taken in...
Lockhart begins to circulate papers. Harry and Ron
examine the questions. Ron WHISPERS to Harry.

RON

Look at these questions. They're
all about him.

HARRY

'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?'

RON

'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?'

HARRY

'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's
birthday and what would his ideal
gift be?'

GILDEROY LOCKHART

You have thirty minutes. Start --
now!
As quills begin to dart across pages, we --

DISSOLVE TO:

SAME SCENE - LATER




Lockhart rifles through the completed exams.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Tut, tut. Hardly any of you
remembered my favorite color is
lilac. But Miss Hermione Granger
knew that my secret ambition is to
rid the world of evil and market
my own range of hair care potions.
Good girl.
Hermione beams. Lockhart's expression suddenly darkens.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Now... be warned! It is my job to
arm you against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind!
You may find yourself facing your
own worst fears in this room.
Know only that no harm can befall
you whilst I am here...
With a showman's flair, Lockhart turns slowly to the cage.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

I must ask you not to scream. It
might provoke them.
A pale Neville draws back. Harry and Ron lean forward.
Lockhart lets the tension build, then WHIPS off the
cover. Inside the cage are several electric blue
CREATURES. Eight inches tall, with pointed faces and
wings, they rattle the bars and pull bizarre faces at the
students.

SEAMUS

Cornish pixies?

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
Unable to control himself, Seamus SNORTS with laughter.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan,
but pixies can be devilishly
tricky little blighters. Let's
see what you make of them now!
Lockhart flings open the cage. Instantly, the pixies
rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles,
BREAKING BEAKERS and shredding books. Two SEIZE Neville
by the ears, lift him into the air, and begin to circle
the ceiling.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Come on now, round them up, round

(brandishing his wand)
Peskipiski Pesternomi!
The spell has absolutely no effect. A particularly
obnoxious pixie makes a face, seizes Lockhart's wand and
tosses it out the window. Lockhart joins the stampede to
the door.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

I'll ask you three to just nip the
rest of them back into their cage.
SLAMMING the door, he's gone. Harry, Ron and Hermione
stand blinking. Ron swats a pixie gnawing his ear.

RON

What do we do now?

HERMIONE

(raising her wand)
Immobilus!
The pixies FREEZE IN MIDAIR. Neville falls, PLOPS onto
Lockhart's desk, shaken but unhurt. He looks at
Hermione.

NEVILLE

Why is it always me?

42B INT. SEVENTH FLOOR - CORRIDOR - LATER 42B

Fresh from the pixies, Hermione, Ron, Harry and Neville
walk. Hair askew. Robes shredded.

RON

I'm sure Professor Lockhart just
wanted to give us some hands-on
experience.

Hands on? Hermione, he didn't

The Gryffindor Quidditch team -- Harry, Fred, George,
ALICIA SPINNET, KATIE BELL, and ANGELINA JOHNSON -- trail
Oliver Wood through the courtyard, toward the distant
Quidditch pitch. Several students are outside, studying.

WOOD

I spent the summer devising a
whole new Quidditch program.
We're going to train earlier,
harder, and longer!
(squinting)
What the... I don't believe it!
Crossing the courtyard from the other side are SEVEN BOYS
in GREEN ROBES, also carrying broomsticks. At their lead
is MARCUS FLINT, trollish Slytherin Captain. Ron,
sitting at a table with Hermione, looks up.

45 CONTINUED: 45





RON

Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

WOOD

Clear out, Flint! I booked the
pitch for Gryffindor today.

FLINT

Easy, Wood. I've got a note.
As Wood snatches the PARCHMENT from Flint's hand, Ron and
Hermione come up to join the others.

WOOD

'I, Professor Severus Snape, do
hereby give the Slytherin team
permission to practice today,
owing to the need to train their
new Seeker.'
(looking up)
You've got a new Seeker? Who?
A pasty-faced boy pushes to the front. It's... Malfoy.

HARRY

Draco?

DRACO

That's right. And that's not all
that's new this year...
As one, the seven Slytherins hold out seven brand-new
GLEAMING BROOMSTICKS. The Gryffindors look stunned.

RON

Those are Nimbus Two Thousand
Ones.

FLINT

A generous gift from Draco's
father.

DRACO

That's right, Weasley. You see,
unlike some, my father can afford
to buy the best.

HERMIONE

At least no one on the Gryffindor
team had to buy their way in.
They got in on pure talent.

45 CONTINUED: (2) 45





DRACO

No one asked your opinion, you
filthy little Mudblood.



Everyone reacts as if Malfoy has said something horrific
-- everyone save Harry, who looks puzzled. Instantly,
Fred and George fly for Draco's throat. Oliver Wood
holds them back.

WOOD

Save it for the match.

RON

You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!
(whips out his wand)
Eat slugs!
Ron points his cracked wand at Malfoy. PFFT! -- a BOLT
of GREEN LIGHT scissors out the wrong end, hitting Ron
himself in the stomach. As he drops to the grass,
Hermione runs to him

HERMIONE

Ron! Say something!
Ron opens his mouth and... BELCHES. Hermione draws back,
and watches a TRIO of SLUGS dribble out his mouth. The
Slytherins CROW with LAUGHTER. Angrily, Ron rises, only
to BELCH again. Fascinated, Colin Creevey runs up with
his camera.

COLIN

Wow! Can you hold him still,
Harry?!

HARRY

Get out of the way, Colin!
(to Hermione)
Let's take him to Hagrid. He'll
know what to do.




46 INT. HAGRID'S HUT - DAY 46

Hagrid rummages about, looking for something.

HAGRID

Got jus' the thing. Set 'im down

As Ron sits, Hagrid pitches a BUCKET between his knees.
Harry and Hermione glance up questioningly. Hagrid
shrugs.

HAGRID

Better out than in. Who was he

HARRY

Malfoy. He called Hermione, well,
I don't know exactly what it
means...

HERMIONE

(quietly)
He called me a Mudblood.

HAGRID

He didn'!
Harry looks confused. Hermione glances at him, then
away, obviously pained by this.

HERMIONE

It means dirty blood. Mudblood's
a really foul name for someone who
was Muggle-born. Someone with
non-magic parents. Someone...
like me. It's not a term one
usually hears in civilized
conversation.

HAGRID

Yeh see, Harry. There are some
wizards -- like Malfoy's family --
who think they're better than
everyone else 'cause they're what
people call pureblood.

HARRY

That's horrible.

RON

(BELCHES forth a
slug)
It's disgusting!

HAGRID

An' it's codswallop ter boot.
Dirty blood. There's 'ardly a
wizard today that's not half-blood
or less. If we 'adn't married
Muggles we'd've died out long ago.
Besides, they haven't invented a
spell our Hermione can't do...

CAMERA PANS the walls of Lockhart's office, lined with
FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS of... Gilderoy Lockhart. Harry and
Lockhart work by candlelight at an ornate desk. Bleary-
eyed, Harry addresses envelopes, while a cheery Lockhart
puts his signature to the stack of GLOSSY PHOTOS bearing
his image.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you
possibly imagine a better way to
serve detention than by helping me
answer my fan mail?
Harry forces a smile.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Fame's a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.
Remember that.
Harry nods, glancing gloomily at the towering stack of
envelopes that remain. Dipping his quill, he starts to
write, when... a CHILLY VOICE fills the room.

VOICE

Come... come to me...

ENEMIES OF THE HEIR... BEWARE.


HERMIONE

'The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened...?'

RON

What's that? Hanging underneath?

HARRY

That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris.
The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket,
eyes open and blank. Harry's eyes shift to the adjacent
WINDOW: near the topmost pane, SPIDERS scuttle up a
silvery thread, fight to get through a crack in the
glass.

HERMIONE

Look at that. Have you ever seen
spiders act like that? Ron...?

RON

(backing away)
I... don't... like... spiders.
Suddenly, the stairwell is alive with VOICES and, seconds
later, dozens of students stream forth, CHATTERING...

Harry, Ron and Hermione. A thudding SILENCE falls. Then
Draco pushes forward, eyes the wall, and grins nastily.

DUMBLEDORE

Everyone will proceed to their
dormitories immediately.

Hermione)
Everyone except you three.
As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wall
and, with extreme gentleness, removes Mrs. Norris.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

It was definitely a curse that
killed her -- probably the
Transmogrifian Torture.
Encountered it myself once, in
Ouagadougou. The full story's in
my autobiography...

DUMBLEDORE

She's not dead, Argus. She's been
Petrified.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

DUMBLEDORE

But how she's been Petrified... I

Harry, Ron and Hermione walk down the corridor.

A Squib's someone who's born into

any powers of their own. It's why
Filch is trying to learn magic
from a Kwikspell course. It's
also why he hates students so
much. He's bitter.
Hermione, who's only been half-listening -- as if trying
to unravel something in her mind -- speaks then.

Harry. This voice. You said you
heard it first in Lockhart's
office?

HARRY

Yes.

HERMIONE

And did he hear it?

HARRY

He said he didn't.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (CONT'D)
Godric Gryffindor, Helga
Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and
Salazar Slytherin. Three of the
founders co-existed quite
harmoniously. One did not.

RON

Three glasses who?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective about the students
admitted to Hogwarts. He believed
that magical learning should be
kept within all-magic families.
In other words, purebloods.
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.
(a beat)
According to legend, Slytherin had
built a hidden chamber in this
castle, known as the Chamber of
Secrets. Shortly before
departing, he sealed it until that
time when his own true heir
returned to the school. The heir
alone would be able to open the
Chamber of Secrets and unleash the
horror within, and by so doing,
purge the school of all those who,
in Slytherin's view, were unworthy
to study magic.

HERMIONE

Muggle-borns.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Yes. Naturally, the school has been
searched many times for such a
chamber. It has never been found.

HERMIONE

Professor, what exactly does
legend tell us lies within the
Chamber?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
The Chamber is said to be home to
something which the heir of Slytherin
alone can control. It is said to be
home... to a monster.

himself.

But if there really is a Chamber
of Secrets, and it's really been
opened, that means...

HERMIONE

The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who
is it?

RON

(in mock puzzlement)
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks Muggle-borns are scum.

HERMIONE

(eyeing Malfoy ahead)
If you're talking about him --

RON

Of course! You heard him:
'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!

HERMIONE

I heard him. But Malfoy? The
Heir of Slytherin?

HARRY

Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I
mean, look at his family. The
whole lot of them have been in
Slytherin for centuries.

RON

Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe
we could trick them into
telling...

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 56.




63 CONTINUED: 63





HERMIONE

No. Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.
Mind you, it would be difficult.
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about fifty school rules. And it
would be dangerous. Very
dangerous.

RON

When do we start?




64 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 64

In a dark nook, Harry, Ron and Hermione huddle round a
book entitled Moste Potente Potions. The spotted pages
are littered with DISTURBING ILLUSTRATIONS.

HERMIONE

Here it is: 'The Polyjuice
Potion. Properly brewed, the
Polyjuice Potion allows the
drinker to transform himself
temporarily into the physical form
of another...'

RON

You mean, Harry and I drink some
of this stuff and we turn into
Crabbe and Goyle?

HERMIONE

Yes.

RON

Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!

HERMIONE

Exactly. But it's tricky. I've
never seen a more complicated
potion. Lacewing flies, leeches,
fluxweed. And, of course, we'll
need a bit of whoever we want to
change into too.

RON

Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing
with Crabbe's toenails in it.

(CONTINUED)





57.





64 CONTINUED: 64





HARRY

How long will it take to make?

HERMIONE

A month.

HARRY

A month? But if Malfoy is the
heir of Slytherin... he could
attack half the Muggle-borns in
the school by then.

HERMIONE

You didn't have to tell me that.




65 EXT. QUIDDITCH STADIUM - DAY 65

We join the Quidditch match in mid-game. The CROWD
ROARS, watching as Slytherin Chasers, bent low over their
new brooms, jet past the overmatched Gryffindors.

HAGRID

Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's
flyin' like they got dragon fire
in their brooms...
Ron fumes, looking as though he takes Slytherin's
dominance personally. Taking Hagrid's GIANT BINOCULARS,
he trains them on the FACULTY BOX -- where Lucius Malfoy
sits next to Snape.
Harry circles high above the pitch, searching for the
Golden Snitch. Suddenly, Malfoy streaks by overhead.

DRACO

All right there, Scarhead?
Harry turns, eyes Malfoy malevolently. Behind him, a
BLUDGER drops INTO FRAME, begins to streak toward his
head.

GEORGE


HARRY! WATCH OUT!

Harry wheels and at the last possible moment, slips the
WHISTLING Bludger. CRACK! George swoops down, BATS it
away. Harry turns, watches it soar away, then blinks:
the Bludger turns, streaks right back at him. Harry JETS

OFF.


(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 58.




65 CONTINUED: 65





HAGRID

(from the stands)
Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a
Rogue Bludger!




RON

Rogue Bludger?

HAGRID

Look fer yerself! It's bin'
tampered with!
Harry executes a series of zigs, zags, loops and rolls,
trying to shake the Bludger, but the Bludger is
relentless.
Ron instinctively draws his wand, begins to point it
toward Harry and the Bludger, when... Hermione's hand
intercedes. She glances knowingly at his fractured wand.

HERMIONE

You're joking, right? Besides,
even with a proper wand, it's too
risky. You could hit Harry.
As Harry frantically dips and dives, Malfoy cruises by.

DRACO

Training for the ballet, Potter?
Harry glances at Malfoy's sneering face. BUZZING inches
above Malfoy's left ear is... the GOLDEN SNITCH. Harry
CHARGES. Malfoy GULPS, swings clear, and watches Harry
rocket past.
As Harry chases the plummeting Snitch, Malfoy FOLLOWS IN
HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing the HISSING
SNITCH deep into the TRENCH circling the pitch. Shoulder
to shoulder, they RACE MADLY, driving and dodging the
wooden support beams that crisscross their path.
Directly behind them, the Bludger FOLLOWS, SHATTERING the
BEAMS as it dogs Harry.
Malfoy KICKS Harry, forcing him to the edge of the
trench. Harry BRUSHES the wall, battling for control.
Malfoy turns, SNICKERS, then looks back... and finds
himself heading smack into a wooden beam. Panicked, he
tries to pull up. Too late. Broom meets beam and Malfoy
spirals out of the trench and -- THWUMP! -- flat on his
back in the middle of the pitch.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 58A.




65 CONTINUED: (1A) 65




Harry continues on, CLOSING on the Snitch, fingertips
only inches from catching it... when... the Rogue Bludger
SMASHES INTO Harry's arm.



Harry cries out, steadies himself and with a brilliant,
acrobatic move, SNATCHES the Snitch out of the air with
his good hand. Unable to control his broom with his
shattered arm, he hits the pitch with a SICKENING THUD.
Wincing, Harry rolls onto his shoulders, SQUINTS UP: a
BLACK DOT -- growing rapidly LARGER -- is plummeting from
the sky, directly toward him. It's... the rogue Bludger.
Instantly, Harry spins away, grimacing in agony, as the
Bludger...
... hits the ground like a SLEDGE HAMMER, violently
TATTOOING the pitch again and again, only inches from
Harry. Calmly, Hermione strides forth, points her wand.

HERMIONE

Finite Incantatem!
The Bludger hangs briefly in the air. Slowly ceases
spinning. Drops heavily to the pitch. Harry exhales,
relieved, only to recall the searing pain in his arm. As
CONCERNED FACES swim above him, one particular face
pushes through the others:

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Not to worry, Harry. I'll fix
that arm of yours straight away.

HARRY

No... no... not you.

(CONTINUED)





59.





65 CONTINUED: (3) 65





GILDEROY LOCKHART

Poor boy doesn't know what he's
saying. This won't hurt a bit...



Lockhart TWIRLS his WAND, Harry braces himself, and...
nothing. He blinks, looks up: the faces -- which now
include Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid -- look horror-
stricken.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Ah. Yes. Well, that can
sometimes happen. The point is,
the bones are no longer broken.

HAGRID

Brok'n? He doesn't 'ave any bones
at all!
Harry looks: his arm looks like an empty rubber glove.




66 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 66

A dazed Malfoy slumps out with Crabbe and Goyle. Ron,
standing by Harry's bed with Hermione, grins, then
watches MADAM POMFREY pour out a STEAMING BEAKERFUL OF
LIQUID from a bottle of SKELE-GRO. A group of
Gryffindors, including some of his teammates, stand
nearby.

MADAM POMFREY

He should have been brought
straight to me! I can mend bones
in a heartbeat -- but growing them
back --

HERMIONE

You will be able to, won't you?

MADAM POMFREY

I'll be able to, certainly, but it
will be painful. You're in for a
rough night, Potter. Regrowing
bones is nasty business.
Harry takes the steaming cup and drinks. Grimaces.

MADAM POMFREY

Well, what did you expect --
pumpkin juice?
FLASH! Harry blinks, sees Colin Creevey standing there.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 60.




66 CONTINUED: 66





COLIN

That was brilliant today, Harry!
Brilliant!




MADAM POMFREY

Out! All of you! This boy's got
thirty-three bones to regrow!




67 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT 67

Harry fidgets in the darkness, half-asleep, then... his
eyelids flutter slowly open...




HARRY'S MOVING POV

From the shadows that cling to the ceiling... to the
lattice-work of moonlight that burns softly on the walls
around him...




BACK TO SCENE

He SENSES something... a presence... when...
Five BANDAGED FINGERS ENTER FRAME, begin to SPONGE his
brow. Harry bolts upright, finds...

HARRY

Dobby!

DOBBY

Harry Potter came back to school.
Dobby warned him. Harry Potter
should have listened to Dobby.
Harry Potter should have gone back
home when he missed the train.

HARRY

(pushing the sponge
away)
It was you! You stopped the
barrier from letting Ron and me
through!

DOBBY

Indeed yes, sir. Dobby hid and
watched for Harry Potter and
sealed the gateway.

HARRY

You nearly got Ron and me
expelled!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 60A.




67 CONTINUED: (A1) 67





DOBBY

At least you would be away from
here. Harry Potter must go home!
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see --

HARRY

Your Bludger? You made that
Bludger chase after me?

(CONTINUED)





61.





67 CONTINUED: 67





DOBBY

Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.
(waggling his fingers)
Dobby had to iron his hands...




HARRY

You'd better clear off before my
bones come back, Dobby, or I might
strangle you!

DOBBY

(smiling weakly)
Dobby is used to death threats,
sir. Dobby gets them five times a
day at home.

HARRY

I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

DOBBY

Not kill you, sir, never kill you!
Dobby remembers how it was before
Harry Potter triumphed over He Who
Must Not Be Named. We house elves
were treated like vermin, sir. Of
course, Dobby is still treated
like vermin...
Dobby HONKS his nose on the filthy pillowcase he wears.

HARRY

Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

DOBBY

This, sir? 'Tis a mark of the
house elf's enslavement. Dobby
can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes. The
family is careful not to pass
Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for
then he would be free to leave
their house forever.
Dobby's ears QUIVER, detecting... FOOTSTEPS. He

WHISPERS.


DOBBY

Terrible things are about to
happen at Hogwarts! Harry Potter
must not stay here now that
history is to repeat itself!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 62.




67 CONTINUED: (2) 67





HARRY

Repeat itself? You mean, this has
happened before?



Dobby seizes the Skele-Gro, BEATS himself about the head.

HARRY

Tell me, Dobby? When did this
happen before? Who's doing it
now?

DOBBY

Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only
wants Harry Potter to be safe.

HARRY

Who is it?
No, Dobby! Tell me!
CRACK! Dobby is gone. SHADOWS flicker beyond the
CURTAIN encircling Harry's bed. Harry slumps down...
peers through a slit in the curtains. Dumbledore, in a
nightcap, and McGonagall, in a tartan robe, heave a SMALL
STATUE onto an empty bed. Seconds later, Madam Pomfrey
bustles in.

MADAM POMFREY

What's happened?

DUMBLEDORE

There's been another attack.
Madam Pomfrey GASPS. It is not a statue lying there. It
is Colin Creevey, CAMERA still clutched to his eye.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Perhaps he managed to get a
picture of his attacker...
Dumbledore opens the camera. A JET OF STEAM HISSES
forth.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
What does this mean, Albus?

DUMBLEDORE

It means our students are in great
danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was
fortunate. If not for this...
(holding up the camera)
He would surely be dead.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 62A.




67 CONTINUED: (3) 67




PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
What sould I tell the staff,
Albus?




DUMBLEDORE

Tell them the truth. Tell them
Hogwarts is no longer safe. Tell
them it's as we feared. The
Chamber of Secrets is indeed open
again.




68 OMITTED 68





68A EXT. GIRLS BATHROOM 68A

We PAN SLOWLY FROM the defiled wall to the bathroom door.




63.





69 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DAY 69




A gloomy place. Cracked mirrors. Chipped sinks.
Guttering candles. Harry and Ron huddle over a SMALL,
BUBBLING CAULDRON, as Hermione adds STRANGE INGREDIENTS.




HERMIONE

Again? You mean, the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened before?

RON

Of course! Don't you see? Lucius
Malfoy must've opened it when he
was at school here, and now he's
told Draco how to do it.

HERMIONE

Maybe. We'll have to wait for the
Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

RON

Enlighten me. Why are we
brewing this potion in broad
daylight, in the middle of a
girls' lavatory? Don't you think
we'll get caught?

HERMIONE

Never. No one over comes in here.

RON

Why?

HERMIONE

Moaning Myrtle.

RON

Who's Moaning Myrtle?
There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A

YOUNG GIRL COMES RACING OUT OF THE WALL. FACE TO FACE

with Ron.

MOANING MYRTLE

I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't
expect you to know me. Who
would ever talk about fat, ugly,
miserable, moping, moaning
Myrtle?
Myrtle SOBS LOUDLY, DIVES head first into the toilet.

HERMIONE

She's a little sensitive.




64.





70 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 70




NOTICE-BOARD: DUELING CLUB! First Meeting Tonight. A
GOLDEN STAGE has been erected. Lockhart struts atop it.
Harry, Ron, Hermione and good number of other students
watch.




GILDEROY LOCKHART

Gather round! Gather round! Can
everyone see me? Can you all hear
me? Excellent. In light of the
dark events of recent weeks,
Professor Dumbledore has granted
me permission to start this little
Dueling Club, to train you all up
in case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done
on countless occasions -- for full
details, see my published works.
The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns to
him.

JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY

That Lockhart's something, isn't
he? Awfully brave chap.
(offering his hand)
Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Hufflepuff.

HARRY

Nice to meet you. I'm --

JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY

I know who you are. We all do.
Even us Muggle-borns.
Justin grins agreeably, looks back to the stage, where
Professor Snape has joined Lockhart.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Let me introduce my assistant
Professor Snape. He has
sportingly agreed to help me with
a short demonstration. Now I
don't want any of you youngsters
to worry. You'll still have your
Potions Master when I'm through
with him, never fear!

RON

What's the fun in that?
Lockhart and Snape face each other and bow. They turn,
walk ten paces, then... SPIN... wands poised like swords.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 65.




70 CONTINUED: 70





GILDEROY LOCKHART

As you can see, we are holding our
wands in the accepted combative
position. On the count of three,
we will cast our first spells.
Neither of us will be aiming to
kill, of course.

HARRY

(eyeing Snape)
I wouldn't bet on that.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

One-two-three --

SNAPE

Expelliarmus!
A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS
Lockhart off his feet and into the wall behind.

HERMIONE

Do you think he's all right?

HARRY/RON

Who cares?

GILDEROY LOCKHART

(rising unsteadily)
Well, there you have it. That was
a Disarming Charm. As you see,
I've lost my wand.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

(as Hermione returns it)
Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes,
an excellent idea to show them
that, Professor Snape, but if you
don't mind my saying so, it was
very obvious what you were about
to do. If I had wanted to stop
you it would have been only too
easy...

SNAPE

Perhaps it would be prudent to
first teach the students to block
unfriendly spells, Professor.

(CONTINUED)





66.





70 CONTINUED: (2) 70





GILDEROY LOCKHART

An excellent suggestion, Professor
Snape. Let's have a volunteer
pair. Potter, Weasley, how about
you?

SNAPE

Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells. We'll
be sending Potter to the hospital
wing in a matchbox. Might I
suggest someone from my own house.
Malfoy, perhaps.
Malfoy and Harry eye each other malevolently as they take
their places onstage. Grudgingly, they bow to each
other.

DRACO

Scared, Potter?

HARRY

You wish.
They turn, walk ten paces, then WHIRL, wands poised.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Wands at the ready! When I count
to three, cast your charms to
disarm your opponent -- only to
disarm. We don't want any
accidents. One, two --
Malfoy FIRES early, knocking Harry off his feet with a
BLAST of WHITE LIGHT. He jumps up, points his wand.

HARRY

Rictusempra!
A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach.
He doubles up, WHEEZING.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

I said disarm only!

DRACO

Serpensortia!
To Harry's horror, the tip of Malfoy's wand EXPLODES and
a LONG BLACK SNAKE SLITHERS forth. Snape smiles with
amusement.

(CONTINUED)





67.





70 CONTINUED: (3) 70





SNAPE

Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid
of it for you.




GILDEROY LOCKHART

Allow me!
Lockhart flicks his wand. BANG! The SNAKE flies into
the air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight towards
Justin Finch-Fletchley. As students SCREAM, Harry --
oddly calm -- approaches the snake. It rises, fangs
exposed, poised to strike Justin.

HARRY

(in Parseltongue)
Leave him!
The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.

HARRY

(in Parseltongue)

LEAVE HIM!

The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously --
slumps to the floor. Harry blinks, as if coming out of a
trance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his hand
to Justin.

JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY

What are you playing at?
Terrified, Justin backs away. Confused, Harry eyes the
faces around him. Malfoy looks shocked. Seamus and
Neville's eyes glitter with fear. Ginny bolts the room.
Snape waves his wand and the snake VANISHES in PUFF OF
BLACK SMOKE, then regards Harry with a look that is both
shrewd and calculating.

RON

(taking Harry's arm)
Come on. Move. Now.




71 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - DAY (LATER) 71

Ron and Hermione usher Harry inside. Harry glances up,
sees Ginny Weasley staring down at him from the top of
the stairs. As their eyes meet, she turns for the girls'
dormitory.

RON

You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't
you tell us?

(CONTINUED)





68.





71 CONTINUED: 71





HARRY

I'm a what?

HERMIONE

You can talk to snakes.

HARRY

I know. I mean, I accidentally
set a python on my cousin Dudley
at the zoo once. But so what? I
bet loads of people here can do
it.

HERMIONE

No. They can't. It's not a very
common gift, Harry. This is bad.

HARRY

What's bad? If I hadn't told that
snake not to attack Justin --

RON

Oh, that's what you said to it.

HARRY

You were there! You heard me!

RON

I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

HARRY

I spoke a different language? But
I didn't realize -- how can I
speak a language without knowing I
can?

HERMIONE

I don't know, Harry. But it
sounded like you were egging the
snake on or something. It was...
creepy.
As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harry
warily. Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk by
without a word.

HERMIONE

Harry, listen out me. There's a
reason the symbol of Slytherin
house is a serpent. Salazar
Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He
could talk to snakes too.

(CONTINUED)





69.





71 CONTINUED: (2) 71





RON

Exactly. And now the whole
school's going to think you're his
great-great-great grandson or
something.

HARRY

But I'm not. I... can't be.

HERMIONE

He lived a thousand years ago.
For all we know... you could be.




72 EXT. HOGWARTS' LANDSCAPE - DAY 72

A heavy snow falls. Harry sits atop one of the towering
hills facing Hogwarts. Hedwig sits beside him.

HARRY

Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?




73 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 73

The trio study. Harry, burdened by dark thoughts, looks
up at Ron.



He smiles at Harry, then, seconds later, Hermione does
the same -- something forced about it all. Unable to
bear it, Harry gathers his books, gets up from the table.
As Harry walks, students glance up, meet his gaze, then
look away. Even MADAM PINCE eyes him from her desk.
Ginny Weasley, tired and pale, scribbles furiously in a

SMALL BLACK BOOK.

Harry exits, walks into the hallway and pauses. From
inside a room, the VOICES of a group of Hufflepuffs can
be heard.

ERNIE

So, anyway, I told Justin to hide
up in our dormitory. I mean to
say, if Potter's marked him down
as his next victim, it's best he
keep a low profile for a while.

HANNAH

But why would he want to attack
Justin?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 70.




73 CONTINUED: 73





ERNIE

Justin let it slip to Potter that
he was Muggle-born.




HANNAH

And you definitely think Potter's
the Heir of Slytherin?

ERNIE

Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.
Everyone knows that's the mark of
a dark wizard. Have you ever
heard of a decent one who could
talk to snakes? They called
Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.
(whispering darkly)
Remember what was written on the
wall: Enemies of the Heir Beware.
Potter had some sort of run-in
with Filch. Next thing we know,
Filch's cat's attacked. That
first-year Creevey's been annoying
Potter. Then Creevey's attacked.

HANNAH

He always seems so nice, though.
And, after all, he is the one who
made You Know Who disappear.

ERNIE

That's probably why You Know Who
wanted to kill him in the first
place. Didn't want another Dark
Lord competing with him.
Harry doesn't need to hear anymore. He slips quietly
away.




74 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 74

MUTTERING, Harry storms straight into Hagrid, who
stands covered in snow, a DEAD ROOSTER dangling from
his hand.

HAGRID

All righ', Harry?

HARRY

Hagrid... what're you doing
here?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 71.




74 CONTINUED: 74





HAGRID

the rooster)
Second one killed this term.
Reckon it's either foxes or a
Blood-Suckin' Bugbear. Need
Dumbledore's permission ter put a
charm round the hen-coop. Yeh
sure yeh're all righ', Harry? Yeh
look all hot an' bothered.

HARRY

It's nothing. I'd better get
going. I've got a lot of
studying...




75 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 75

Harry enters, slows. Up ahead, in the light of a
FLICKERING TORCH, something DARK lies. A WINDOWPANE
RATTLES in the WIND and the torch... goes out. Harry
steps closer, finds...
Justin-Finch-Fletchley. Lying rigid on the floor, a look
of shock on his frozen face. Nearby, an inert Nearly
Headless Nick floats, body teeming with BLACK SMOKE.
Kneeling, Harry notices a TRAIL OF SPIDERS scuttling away
from Justin's body and out the loose windowpane... when
suddenly...
... Harry senses someone watching him, wheels:
McGonagall.

HARRY

Professor, I swear I didn't --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
This is out of my hands, Potter.
Mr. Filch, will you take care of
this, please?
Harry's eyes shift. Filch lurks in the shadows beyond
McGonagall. He steps forward, HISSES QUIETLY.

FILCH

Caught in the act. I'll have you
out this time, Potter. Mark my
words...
As McGonagall leads Harry away, he looks back. Filch
stares at Justin and Nick, then turns. CAMERA DOLLYS

AWAY FROM HIM.


(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 72.




75 CONTINUED: 75





FILCH

Dark magic. That's what you've
got, Potter. Even the air you
breathe comes out poison. You're
evil. Evil as they come...




76 INT. GARGOYLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 76

McGonagall marches Harry down to an UGLY STONE GARGOYLE.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sherbet lemon.
The Gargoyle SPRINGS TO LIFE, its wings opening.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Professor Dumbledore will be
waiting for you.
McGonagall ushers Harry inside. It's an elevator. The
Gargoyle's wings close. Harry rises to an upper floor.




77 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 77

Harry steps out of the Gargoyle's embrace and enters a
large, circular room. STRANGE SILVER INSTRUMENTS WHIR
quietly. On a nearby shelf, the SORTING HAT sits. Harry
casts a wary eye at the PAST HEADMASTERS snoozing in the
PORTRAITS around him. In the last portrait, the
Headmaster is awake, reading a book. He is PROFESSOR
DIPPET. Harry approaches the Sorting Hat, glances
around, then places it atop his head.

SORTING HAT

Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

HARRY

Well, you see, I was wondering...

(CONTINUED)





73.





77 CONTINUED: 77





SORTING HAT

If I put you in the right house?
Yes... you were particularly
difficult to place. But I stand
by what I said last year... you
would have done well in Slytherin.
Harry strips the hat off, tosses it back onto the shelf.

HARRY

You're wrong!
The hat sits motionless. Silent. Hearing a GAGGING
SOUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD (FAWKES)
sitting on a GOLDEN PERCH. It wobbles, then... BURSTS
INTO FLAMES. As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horror-
struck.

HARRY

Professor, your bird... I couldn't
do anything... He just caught
fire.

DUMBLEDORE

About time too. He's been looking
dreadful for days. Pity you had
to see him on a Burning Day. He's
really very handsome most of the
time.
(off Harry's look)
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
Phoenixes burst into flame when it
is time for them to die and are
reborn from the ashes.
Harry looks to the floor. The ASHES swirl. A baby
Fawkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through the
dust.

DUMBLEDORE

Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy
loads, their tears have healing
powers, and they make highly
faithful pets.
Just then, Hagrid -- still clutching the dead rooster --
BURSTS through the door.

HAGRID

It wasn't Harry, Professor
Dumbledore!

HAGRID! I do not think that Harry
has attacked anyone.

HAGRID

Oh. Right. I'll wait outside
then.
As Hagrid exits, Harry looks hopefully at Dumbledore.

HARRY

You don't think it was me,
Professor?

DUMBLEDORE

No, Harry. But I must ask you...
is there anything you'd like to
tell me. Anything at all?
Dumbledore waits. Harry debates. Finally...

HARRY

No, Professor. Nothing.




78 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY 78

Students drift into the snow with their trunks, heading
home for holiday. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear,
Ernie and few others cast wary glances.

FRED

Make way for the Heir of
Slytherin! Seriously evil wizard
coming through!
Ron grins, amused, then sees Harry -- anything but.

78 CONTINUED: 78





RON

Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just
having a laugh.




HARRY

He's the only one.

RON

Okay, so half the school thinks
you're nipping off to the Chamber
of Secrets every night. Who
cares?

HARRY

Maybe they're right.

HERMIONE

(reproachfully)
Harry!

HARRY

(frustrated)
I didn't know I could speak
Parseltongue. What else don't I
know about myself? Maybe you can
do something... even something
horrible... and not know you did
it.

HERMIONE

You don't believe that, Harry, I
know you don't. And if it makes
you feel better, I just heard
Malfoy's staying over for holiday,
too.

RON

Why would that make anyone feel
better?

HERMIONE

Because, in a few days, the
Polyjuice Potion's will be ready.
In a few days... we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.




79 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 79

The Christmas Feast. The Hall glimmers grandly as
snowflakes tumble from the ceiling. Harry and Ron sit
with Hermione.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 75A.




79 CONTINUED: (A1) 79





HERMIONE

Everything's set. We just need a
bit of who you're changing into.




HARRY

Crabbe and Goyle.

HERMIONE

And we also need to make sure that
the real Crabbe and Goyle can't
burst in on us while we're
interrogating Malfoy.

RON

How?
Hermione holds up a pair of SMALL CAKES.

HERMIONE

I've got it all worked out. I've
filled these with a simple
Sleeping Draught. Simple, but
powerful.
Ron glances at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who presently
are eating everything in front of them.

HERMIONE

You know how greedy Crabbe and
Goyle are. They won't leave the
Christmas Feast until every last
drop of trifle is gone.

79 CONTINUED: 79





HERMIONE (CONT'D)

Now, once they're asleep, hide
them in a broom cupboard and pull
out a few of their hairs.




RON

And whose hair are you ripping out?

HERMIONE

I've already got mine.
She removes a SMALL VIAL. Inside is a TINY HAIR.

HERMIONE

Millicent Bulstrode. She's in
Slytherin. I got this off her
robes.
(rising)
All right then... I'm going to
check on the Polyjuice Potion.
Hermione points to the cakes in front of her.

HERMIONE

Remember. Just make sure Crabbe
and Goyle find these.
Hermione exits. Ron looks at Harry.

RON

Have you ever heard of a plan
where so many things could go
wrong?

80 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (A BIT LATER) 80

Harry and Ron, lurking behind a SUIT OF ARMOR, watch
Crabbe and Goyle exit the Great Hall.
Goyle spies the cakes instantly, perched on the end of
one of the banisters. Grabbing them, he reluctantly
surrenders one to Crabbe and, in unison, they stuff them
into their mouths. They pause. Look at each other. And
keel flat onto their backs.
Harry and Ron dash out, drag Crabbe and Goyle across the
floor and into a cupboard.




81 INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 81

Hermione, wearing a Slytherin robe, hovers over a smoking
cauldron. Harry and Ron enter.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 11/20/01 76A.




81 CONTINUED: 81





HERMIONE

Did you get it?
Harry and Ron hold up their hands. In each: a TUFT OF
HAIR. Hermione points to a pair of SLYTHERIN ROBES.

HERMIONE

I sneaked those out of the
laundry.
Harry and Ron nod, glance at the cauldron. The potion
resembles a thick, dark, bubbling mud.

(CONTINUED)





77.





81 CONTINUED: 81





HERMIONE

I'm sure I've done everything
right. It looks like the book
said it should. Once we've drunk
it, we'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into
ourselves.

RON

Now what?

HERMIONE

We separate it into three glasses
and add the hairs.
Harry and Ron grimace.

CUT TO:





CLOSEUP - THE POTION

being poured into three glasses.
CAMERA PULLS BACK. Harry and Ron have changed into the
Slytherin robes. All three raise their glasses. Drop
the hairs. The potion turns shades of YELLOW, BROWN, and

KHAKI.


RON

Ugh. Essence of Crabbe...
They nod. DRINK. Ron swallows grimly, doubles over.

RON

Think I'm gonna be sick...
He runs into a stall. Harry looks sick, steps to a
CRACKED MIRROR. Hermione pauses. Looks worried.
Something's wrong...
INSIDE THE STALL: Ron bends over the toilet, watches his
reflection morph into Crabbe.
IN THE CRACKED MIRROR: Harry watches his face contort
into the thick features of Goyle.
Hermione looks at her arm. Patches of fur begin to
spread across her wrist and hand. Terrified, she RUNS
into a stall.
Ron emerges from his stall, a dead ringer for Crabbe.

(CONTINUED)





78.





81 CONTINUED: (2) 81





RON

Harry?

HARRY

Ron?

RON

Bloody hell.

HARRY

We still sound like ourselves.
You need to sound more like
Crabbe.

RON

(adjusts voice)
Bloody hell.

HARRY

Lower.

RON

(lower still)
Bloody hell.

HARRY

Less intelligent.

RON

(dumbing it down)
Bloody hell.

HARRY

Excellent.

RON

Hey... Where's Hermione?

HERMIONE (O.S.)

(from the stall)
I -- I don't think I'm going. You
go on without me.

HARRY

Hermione, are you okay?

HERMIONE (O.S.)

Just go! You're wasting time!

83 EXT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 83







Harry and Ron hurry down the staircase.

RON

Don't swing your arms like that.
Crabbe holds them sort of stiff.
Harry goes a bit more "Neanderthal."

RON

Yeah. That's better.




84 GLOOMY CORRIDOR/DUNGEONS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 84

Harry and Ron move quickly, when... FOOTSTEPS sound.
Seconds later, Percy appears at the end of the corridor.

RON

What are you doing here?
Percy squints, confused by Ron's voice. Harry elbows
Ron, who clears his throat and speaks in a lower voice.

RON

What are you doing here?

PERCY

I happen to be a prefect. You, on
the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.
It's not safe these days.
Harry and Ron NOD, afraid to speak. Percy squints again.

PERCY

What're your names again?

DRACO

Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you
been? Pigging out in the Great
Hall all this time?
Draco is walking towards them, glances witheringly at Percy.

DRACO

And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

PERCY

Mind your attitude, Malfoy. You
want to show a little bit more
respect to a school Prefect!

(CONTINUED)





80.





84 CONTINUED: 84





DRACO

Come on, boys. Weasley thinks
he's going to catch Slytherin's
hair single-handed.



Percy steams. Draco sneers, walks off with Harry and
Ron.




85 OMITTED 85





86 INT. SLYTHERIN COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 86

Harry and Ron trail Draco inside, glance around warily.

DRACO

Listen to this...
Draco grabs The Daily Prophet, reads the front page.

DRACO

'Arthur Weasley, Head of the
Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office,
was today fined fifty Galleons for
bewitching a Muggle car. "Weasley
has brought the Ministry into
disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a
governor of Hogwarts. "He is
clearly unfit to draw up our laws
and his ridiculous Muggle
Protection Act should be scrapped
immediately."'
Grinning, Malfoy glances over the paper at Harry and Ron.

DRACO

Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so
much he should snap his wand in
half and go join them. You'd
never know the Weasleys were
purebloods, the way they behave.
Embarrassment to the wizarding
world. All of them.
Ron growls. Harry elbows him. Draco looks surprised.

DRACO

What's up with you, Crabbe?

RON

(low voice)
Stomachache.

(CONTINUED)





81.





86 CONTINUED: 86





DRACO

Well, go to the hospital wing
and give all those Mudbloods a kick
in the arse for me! You know, I'm
surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't
reported all these attacks yet. I
suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush
it all up. He'll be sacked if it
doesn't stop soon. Father always
said Dumbledore's the worst thing
that's ever happened to this place.

HARRY

You're wrong!

DRACO

What? Did you say that I was
wrong? You think there's someone
here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Ron stiffens. Worried. Harry thinks, then:

HARRY

Harry Potter.

DRACO

(grinning)
Good one, Goyle. You're
absolutely right. Saint Potter.
He's another one with no proper
wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go
around with that Mudblood Granger.
And people actually think he's the
Heir of Slytherin.
Harry and Ron exchange a glance. Harry leans closer to
Draco.

HARRY

Then you must have some idea who's
behind it all?

DRACO

You know I haven't, Goyle. How
many times do I have to tell you?
But my father did say this much:
It's been fifty years since the
Chamber was opened. He wouldn't
tell me who opened it -- only that
they were expelled -- but I know
this: the last time the Chamber
of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood
died.

(MORE)


(CONTINUED)





82.





86 CONTINUED: (2) 86





DRACO (CONT'D)

So it's only a matter of time
before one of them's killed this
time. As for me... I hope it's
Granger.
As Malfoy grins, Ron's fist rises... when Harry stops
him.

DRACO

What's the matter with you two?
You're acting very... odd.

RON

Ho!
Harry turns, sees Ron staring wide-eyed: Harry's SCAR is
beginning to surface beneath the skin of Goyle's thick
forehead. And Crabbe's hair is... turning RED. They
both JUMP to their feet, DASHING out of the room.

DRACO

Hey! Where are you going?




87 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 87

As Harry and Ron race toward the stairs, the BROOM CLOSET
bursts open and a woozy Crabbe and Goyle stagger out.
They freeze -- watch themselves run up the staircase.




88 INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 88

Harry and Ron sprint toward the desecrated wall, their
bodies metamorphosing, until, finally, as they hit the
door...




89 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT 89

... They are fully themselves once more.

RON

That was close!

HARRY

Hermione, come out. We've got
loads to tell you!

HERMIONE

Go away!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 83.




89 CONTINUED: 89




As Harry and Ron exchange a puzzled glance, Moaning
Myrtle spirals INTO VIEW, looking disturbingly...
happy.

MOANING MYRTLE

Ooh, wait till you see. It's
awful!
The stall's lock slides back. The door opens slowly.

HERMIONE (O.S.)

Do you remember me telling you the
Polyjuice Potion was only for
human transformations...?
Even in shadow, they can see: Hermione's face is covered
in FUR, her eyes YELLOW, and POINTED EARS poke through
her hair.

HERMIONE

It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look
at my face!

RON

Look at your tail.




90 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY (TWO WEEKS LATER) 90

Staggering under the weight of the LIBRARY BOOKS in their
arms, Harry and Ron make their way to Hermione's bed,
which is covered in... BOOKS.

HERMIONE

Oh, good. Put those anywhere.
They look. There is no anywhere. So they just... drop
them.

RON

Madam Pince asked that we relay a
message to you, Hermione: She'd
appreciate it if you'd leave a few
books for the rest of the school.

HERMIONE

I've got to keep up, haven't I?
Just then, Hermione's tail twitches INTO VIEW.

RON

Is that thing ever going away?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 84.




90 CONTINUED: 90





HERMIONE

Any day now, according to Madam
Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've
stopped coughing up fur balls.




RON

We all are, believe me.

HERMIONE

Now. What about the Chamber of
Secrets? Any new leads?

HARRY

Nothing.

HERMIONE

And has it gotten any better? I
mean... is anyone speaking to you?

HARRY

Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm
in Potions yesterday. I suppose
that's something.
Ron takes a GET-WELL CARD from under Hermione's pillow.

RON

'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a
speedy recovery, from your
concerned teacher Gilderoy
Lockhart.' You sleep with this
under your pillow?

HERMIONE

Of course not. I don't know how
that got there. Now go. I still
have six hundred pages to read in
Transformation Through the Ages.




91 OMITTED 91





92 EXT. SECOND-FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 92

Harry and Ron mount the stairs, emerge.

RON

I know Hermione's mental, but can
you believe she falls for that
smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 84A.




92 CONTINUED: 92




They stop. Look down. A GREAT FLOOD OF WATER streams
from the Girls' Bathroom. From within, MYRTLE can be
heard MOANING.




HARRY

Looks like Myrtle's flooded the
bathroom.
As Harry sploshes off toward the bathroom, Ron steps
lightly.

RON

Yuck.




93 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 93

HUGE, WRACKING MOANS echo off the dreary tile. All the
taps are running, streaming like tiny waterfalls. As
Harry and Ron step to the last cubicle, Myrtle spins
accusingly.

(CONTINUED)





85.





93 CONTINUED: 93





MOANING MYRTLE

Come to throw something else at
me?




HARRY

Why would I throw something at
you?

MOANING MYRTLE

Don't ask me. Here I am, minding
my own business, and someone
thinks it's funny to throw a book
at me...

RON

But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you. I mean,
it'd just go right through you,
wouldn't it?

MOANING MYRTLE

Oh sure! Let's all throw books at
Myrtle, because she can't feel it!
Ten points if you can get it
through her stomach. Fifty points
if it goes through her head!

HARRY

Who threw it at you anyway?

MOANING MYRTLE

I don't know. I didn't see them.
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death and it fell
through the top of my head.
Harry sees a SMALL BLACK BOOK on the floor. Picks it up.

RON

Fifty points if you can get it
through her nose.

MOANING MYRTLE


I HEARD THAT!

Harry and Ron dash out.

94 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 94

Harry examines the book as he and Ron walk.

HARRY

This is a diary. And it's old...

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/9/02 86.




94 CONTINUED: 94





RON

It's a diary, it's old... and was
most recently in a toilet, Harry.



Harry starts to open it... when Ron grabs his hand.

RON

Are you mad? That could be
cursed. Dad once told me about a
book the Ministry confiscated that
burned the eyes out of anyone who
tried to read it.

HARRY

I'll take my chances...
(opening it)
Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES!
Ron freezes, terrified, when... Harry grins, ending the
ruse. At the end of corridor, Ginny stands, looking from
the diary to Harry -- utter terror on her face -- then
dashes off.

HARRY

Ginny! I was only joking --
Brilliant. Even your sister
thinks I'm the monster now.

RON

Who doesn't?
Ron frowns suddenly. On the first page on the diary,
EMBOSSED LETTERS spell out a name: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE.

RON

Tin Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I
know that name...
(thinking, then)
Of course! The night I had
detention... My job was to polish
the silver in the trophy room. I
remember because I kept burping
slugs all over Tom Riddle's
trophy. I must have wiped slime
off his name for an hour.
Harry fans the pages. They're empty.

HARRY

That's odd. He never wrote in it.




95 INT. HOSPITAL WING - LATER THAT NIGHT 95

CLOSEUP: DIARY. A GOLD EMBOSSED ADDRESS on the back
reads: WAXFLATTER'S BOOKSELLERS. 422 VAUXHALL ROAD.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/9/02 87.




95 CONTINUED: 95




CAMERA PULLS BACK. Harry sits with Hermione in the
moonlit room. Hermione studies the diary curiously.

HERMIONE

Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he
won an award fifty years ago?

HARRY

Special Services to the School or
something --

HERMIONE

Fifty years ago? You're sure?

HARRY

Yes. Why?

HERMIONE

Don't you remember what Malfoy
told you? The last time the
Chamber of Secrets was opened
was --

HARRY

Fifty years ago! That means --

HERMIONE

Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts,
when it happened. What if he
wrote about what he saw? It's
possible he knew where the Chamber
was, how to open it, even what
sort of creature lives in it. If
so, whoever's behind the attacks
this time wouldn't want a diary
like this lying around, would
they?

HARRY

That's a brilliant theory,
Hermione. With just one tiny
little flaw. There's nothing
written in this diary.

HERMIONE

It might be invisible ink.
(pulls out her wand)
Aparecium!
She taps the diary three times. Nothing happens. The
pages remain BLANK. She frowns, passes the book back to
Harry.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 88.




95 CONTINUED: (2) 95





HERMIONE

I don't know, Harry. But I think
you should be careful with this.
Something tells me Ron might be
right. It could be dangerous.

HARRY

You don't think I'm dangerous, do
you, Hermione? I mean, you're not
scared. Of me.

HERMIONE

I'm scared, Harry. But not of
you.




96 INT. GRYFFINDOR DORMITORY/COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 96

CAMERA STARTS OVERHEAD, looking down on the boys'
dormitory. Seamus, Neville, Ron and Dean sleep. One bed
is empty. CAMERA CRANES TO the Common Room, finds Harry
sitting alone, flipping through the blank pages of the
diary.
Harry starts to set the diary aside, then notices a
BOTTLE OF INK sitting on the desk. An idea flickers.
Taking his QUILL, Harry dips it, and hesitates. As he
does, a DROP of INK hangs, suspended like a tear, then...

DROPS.

The ink BLAZES briefly, then... VANISHES... as if it were
sucked into the page. Excited, Harry dips his quill
again, and, this time, writes: My name is Harry Potter.
The words blaze, VANISH. Slowly, oozing out of the page,
comes a response: Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom
Riddle.
Harry's mind races. Deciding, he MUTTERS the words he
writes:

HARRY

Do... you... know... anything...
about... the... Chamber... of...
Secrets?
Yes.

HARRY

Can... you... tell... me?
No.

Harry frowns. Then... slowly... new words ooze to the
surface.
But I can show you...
Harry waits, intrigued. Then, suddenly...
The pages FLUTTER WILDLY, stop on "June the 13th." On
the page, a TINY SQUARE SHIMMERS... like a WINDOW. Harry
lifts the book, puts his eye close and... PITCHES
FORWARD, spilling through the widening window, into a
WHIRL of COLOR and SHADOW, tumbling onto his feet...




97 INT. CORRIDOR/ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (FIFTY YEARS AGO) 97

... in torch-lit corridor. Everything is de-saturated,
save for Harry, who retains the true, rich colors of the
present. He glances about, disoriented, then spies a BOY
(TOM RIDDLE) at the end of the corridor, peering around a
corner. A FLURRY of SHADOWS dances on the wall beyond
the boy, revealing the presence of others, unseen, in an
adjoining room.
As Harry advances, LOW VOICES emanate from the shadows.
As he reaches the boy, Harry speaks in a WHISPER:

HARRY

Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I am? Hello...?
The boy doesn't respond, eyes staked to the activity in
the adjoining room... which Harry sees now is the
Entrance Hall. A group of ELDER WITCHES and WIZARDS --
Hogwarts Professors -- talk amongst themselves, then...
abruptly go silent. Make way for two YOUNG WIZARDS,
bearing a STRETCHER.

VOICE (O.S.)

Riddle.
The boy wheels... and looks right through Harry. Harry
turns, too. It's Dumbledore... fifty years younger.

TOM RIDDLE

Professor Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE

It's not wise to be wandering
around this late, Tom.

Yes, Professor. I suppose I -- I
just had to see for myself, if...



Riddle glances toward the young wizards, watches them
carry the stretcher out of the Hall, into the night.

TOM RIDDLE

... the rumors were true.

DUMBLEDORE

I'm afraid they are, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE

About the school as well? They
wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, Professor?

DUMBLEDORE

Headmaster Dippet may have no
choice, I'm afraid.

TOM RIDDLE

Sir? If it all stopped. If the
person responsible was caught...

DUMBLEDORE

Is there something you wish to
tell me, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE

(a long beat)
No, sir. Nothing.
Dumbledore studies Riddle for a moment.

DUMBLEDORE

Very well then. Hurry along.
Dumbledore strides directly past Harry, not seeing him.
When he is gone, Riddle moves quickly, toward the dungeon
steps.

VOICE (O.S.)

C'mon, Aragog. Gotta get yeh
outta here... C'mon now.. in the
box...



As Riddle pushes the door clear, Harry sees a second,
smaller room. Crouched by a BOX, is a huge boy... YOUNG
HAGRID. A STRANGE CLICKING comes from the BOX.

TOM RIDDLE

Evening, Hagrid.
Hagrid SLAMS the door shut.

TOM RIDDLE

I'm going to have to turn you in,
Hagrid. I don't think you meant
it to kill anyone --

YOUNG HAGRID

No, yeh can't! Yeh don'
understand!

TOM RIDDLE

Hagrid. The dead girl's parents
will be here tomorrow. The least
Hogwarts can do is make sure the
thing that killed their daughter
is slaughtered.

YOUNG HAGRID

It wasn' him! Aragog never'd kill
no one! Never!

RIDDLE

Monsters don't make good pets,
Hagrid. Now... stand aside...
Riddle draws his wand, BLASTS the closed DOOR off its
hinges, extinguishing the torches within. Harry GASPS.
A low-slung CREATURE with a tangle of black legs, a gleam
of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers, scuttles
out of the shadows. As Riddle points his wand at it,
Hagrid LEAPS...

YOUNG HAGRID

Noooooo!

As they tumble to the floor, the entire ROOM WHIRLS off
its axis, spinning, and Harry finds himself plummeting
through color and shadow again, falling flat on his back
to...



... the floor of the Gryffindor Common Room, the ceiling
above spinning, slowly, to a stop. Harry rises, dashes
upstairs.




100A INT. BOYS' DORMITORY - NIGHT 100A

Harry rushes to Ron, shakes him awake, WHISPERING INTENSELY.

HARRY

RON

We don't even know this Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten
snitch to me.

HARRY

The monster had killed someone,
Ron. What would any of us done?

HAGRID

Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin'

The trio wheels, spots Hagrid grinning at them. They
instantly look guilty.

HARRY/RON/HERMIONE

No!
Hagrid looks at them curiously. Harry nods to the
STRANGE CANISTER in his hand.

HARRY

What's that you've got, Hagrid?

HAGRID

RON

Well, whoever it was, they were
looking for something.




HARRY

And they found it... Tom Riddle's
diary is gone.




105 EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY 105

Students stream into the Quidditch Stadium.




105A INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - DAY 105A

Harry, dressed in his Quidditch robes, dashes down the
staircase with Ron and Hermione. Down below, Ron spies
Ginny.

RON

Hey, Ginny! Going to the match?
Ginny looks up, startled, then shakes her head and exits.

RON

I tell you, she gets weirder and
weirder by the day...

VOICE (O.S.)

Kill this time... Let me rip...
Tear.
Harry freezes. Ron and Hermione stop, knowing by his face...

RON

No... don't tell me...
Harry turns, as if following the SOUND, absently touching
his fingers to the wall as he glances around. Hermione
studies him with great interest -- STUDIES HIS FINGERS --
then, abruptly, Harry turns away, shakes his head: it's
gone. Hermione looks up, eyes vaguely upon Harry, but
her mind miles away.

HERMIONE

Harry... I think I've just understood
something! I've got to go to the
library!
As Hermione sprints back up the stairs, Harry YELLS.

HARRY

What do you understand!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 96.

But she's gone. Harry turns to Ron in puzzlement.

HARRY

The library?




RON

That's Hermione. When in doubt,
go to the library




106 EXT. REAR OF QUIDDITCH STADIUM - DAY (LATER) 106

Harry and his teammates march toward the Quidditch tower.
The CHEERS of the CROWD are heard.

WOOD

Listen up now. We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.
We're stronger, quicker, smarter.

GEORGE

Not to mention they're dead
terrified Harry'll Petrify them if
they fly anywhere near him.

WOOD

That, too.
Just then, Professor McGonagall appears, barring their
way.

WOOD

Professor McGonagall --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
This match has been cancelled.

WOOD

Cancelled! They can't cancel
Quidditch --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Silence, Wood! You will return to
Gryffindor Tower now. Potter, you
and I will find Mr. Weasley.
There's something the both of you
need to see.




107 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 107

McGonagall pauses outside the door, turns to Harry and
Ron.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 97.




107 CONTINUED: 107




PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
I warn you. This will be a bit of
a shock.



She opens the door. Madam Pomfrey is leaning over a bed
where a girl lies. As she straightens up, we see the
girl is...

RON

Hermione!
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
She was found near the library.
Along with this. Does it mean
anything to either of you?
She holds up a SMALL CIRCULAR MIRROR. Harry shakes his
head. McGonagall nods gravely, leads them out. As they
go, the CAMERA DRIFTS to HERMIONE'S HAND. Clinched tight
in her stiff knuckles, barely visible, is... a PIECE OF

PAPER.





108 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 108

McGonagall reads from a PARCHMENT to the somber
Gryffindors.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
All students will return to their
house common rooms by six o'clock
in the evening. You will be
escorted to each lesson by a
teacher. No exceptions.
(rolling up
the parchment)
I should tell you all this.
Unless the culprit behind these
attacks is caught, it is likely
that the school will be closed.
McGonagall turns, exits. Instantly, as one, the
students begin to talk amongst themselves. Neville
speaks up.

NEVILLE

Haven't any of the teachers
noticed that the Slytherins are
all safe? Isn't it obvious all
this stuff's coming from
Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin,
the monster of Slytherin -- why
don't they just chuck all the
Slytherins out?

They can't close Hogwarts. Where
would we all go?




DEAN THOMAS

I don't care what anyone says. As
long as Dumbledore's here,
Hogwarts will be here.
Harry WHISPERS to Ron.

HARRY

We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him. But if
he did set the monster loose last
time -- even by accident -- he'll
know how to get inside the Chamber
of Secrets. And that's a start.

RON

But you heard McGonagall. We're
not allowed to leave the tower
except for class --

HARRY

I think it's time to get my Dad's
old Cloak out again.




109 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (LATER) 109

CLOSEUP: A drawer opens, a HAND reaches in, takes the
INVISIBILITY CLOAK. CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Ron and
Harry. All around them, the other boys sleep. Harry
pitches the cloak over himself and Ron. They're gone.

113 EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 113




A KNOCK. Hagrid swings open the door. Crossbow in hand.

HAGRID

Who's there?



Harry and Ron drop the cloak. Hagrid lowers the
crossbow.




114 INT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 114

FANG, Hagrid's enormous BOARHOUND, THUMPS HIS TAIL at the
sight of Harry and Ron. Harry points to the crossbow.

HARRY

What's that for?

HAGRID

Nothin', nothin'. I've been
expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit
down... I'll make tea...
Hagrid nervously takes the kettle, spills the water..

HARRY

Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you
hear about Hermione?

HAGRID

Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'.

HARRY

Look... we have to ask you
something. Do you know who's
opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Hagrid takes a fruit cake, stops, about to answer,
when... there is a LOUD KNOCK. The fruitcake SMASHES to
the floor. Panicked, Harry and Ron throw the cloak over
themselves. Sweating, Hagrid grabs his crossbow, points
it at the door.

HAGRID

C-come in.
The door opens. A grim Dumbledore enters, followed by a
portly man in a pin-stripe suit and bowler: CORNELIUS

FUDGE.


DUMBLEDORE

Good evening, Hagrid.

(CONTINUED)





100.





114 CONTINUED: 114





RON

(whispering to Harry)
That's Dad's boss! Cornelius
Fudge. The Minister of Magic!



Harry elbows Ron to shut him up.

FUDGE

Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad
business. Had to come. Four
attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things've gone far enough.
Ministry's got to act.

HAGRID

I never... You know I never,
Professor Dumbledore, sir...

DUMBLEDORE

I want it understood, Cornelius,
that Hagrid has my full
confidence.

FUDGE

Look, Albus, Hagrid's record's
against him. I've got to take
him.

HAGRID

Take me? Where? Not Azkaban
prison.

FUDGE

For a short stretch only. Not a
punishment, Hagrid. More a
precaution. If someone else is
caught, you'll be released with a
full apology.
Just then, there is a SHARP RAP on the door. As
Dumbledore opens it, Harry slumps. It's Lucius
Malfoy.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Already here, Fudge? Good,
good...

HAGRID

What're you doin' here! Get outta
my house!

(CONTINUED)





101.





114 CONTINUED: (2) 114





LUCIUS MALFOY

My dear man, please believe me, I
have no pleasure at all in being
inside your -- do you call this a
house? I simply called at the
school and was told the Headmaster
was here.

DUMBLEDORE

And what exactly did you want with
me, Lucius?

LUCIUS MALFOY

Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but
the governors feel it's time for
you to step aside. This is an
Order of Suspension. You'll find
all twelve signatures on it. I'm
afraid we feel you're losing your
touch. What with all these
attacks, there'll be no Muggle-
borns left at Hogwarts. And we
all know what an awful loss that
would be.
Malfoy hands Fudge an OFFICIAL ROLL of PARCHMENT.

FUDGE

Now, see here, Lucius. Dumbledore
suspended. No, no... last thing
we want right now... If Dumbledore
can't stop these attacks... I mean
to say, who can?

LUCIUS MALFOY

That remains to be seen, but as
all twelve governors have voted --

HAGRID

An' how many did yeh have ter
threaten before they agreed!

LUCIUS MALFOY

I would advise you not to shout at
the Azkaban guards like that.

HAGRID

Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him
away an' the Muggle-borns won'
stand a chance! There'll be
killin's next!

(CONTINUED)





102.





114 CONTINUED: (3) 114





DUMBLEDORE

Calm yourself, Hagrid!
(steely-eyed)
If the governors want my removal,
Lucius, I shall of course step
aside. However... you will find
that I will only truly have left
this school when none here are
loyal to me. You will also find
that help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who... ask for
it.
Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Admirable sentiments. We shall
all miss your highly individual
way of running things, Albus, and
only hope your successor will
manage to prevent any more, um,
killin's.
Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out.
Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waits for Hagrid.
Instead, Hagrid stands his ground, takes a deep breath
and says carefully...

HAGRID

If anyone wanted ter find out some
stuff, all they'd have ter do is
follow the spiders. That'd lead
'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'.
Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him
out. As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL,
scratching at the closed door. Harry and Ron emerge from
the cloak.

RON

Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore
gone, there'll be an attack a day.

HARRY

Look...
At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a
crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.

HARRY

C'mon.

119 EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 119




Harry illuminates the TRAIL OF SPIDERS. They run from
the window to the ground, to the dark trees in the near
distance. As Harry moves to follow, Ron hesitates.

RON

What are you doing?

HARRY

You heard Hagrid. Follow the
spiders.

RON

They're heading into the Dark
Forest.
Harry sighs, heads off. Terrified, Ron grabs Fang,
follows.

RON

Why spiders. Why couldn't it be
'Follow the butterflies'?




120 OMITTED 120





121 EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT 121

Fang crashes through low-slung branches and sharp
brambles as Harry follows. Ron gingerly picks his way,
the JUMPS... as FANG HOWLS. BRANCHES SNAP. A RUMBLING
NOISE sounds, then... SILENCE. Harry spies something,
points O.S.

HARRY

There's something moving over
there... something big.
Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding
them. They start to flee... when Ron stops.

RON

Harry!... Harry, it's our car!
Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass
sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford
Anglia looks half-animal. Ron circles it in wonder.

HARRY

It's been here all the time! Look

wild.



Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.

HARRY

C'mon, we don't want to lose the
trail.




121A EXT. SPIDERS' HOLLOW - NIGHT 121A

Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows.
Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of
white webbing. Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off
queasily. Harry peers up ahead: at the far end of the
hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING.
As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND
emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall
trees. GROWING LOUDER. Ron falters, glancing about
nervously.

RON

I don't have a good feeling about
this, Harry --

HARRY

Don't panic.
As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR
suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE
SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.

SEES:

An ANCIENT SPIDER (ARAGOG), the size of a small elephant.
As it advances, Harry and Ron back slowly away. Then:
its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS. As if...
listening.

ARAGOG

You do not come from the forest.
Your hearts beat like... men.

HARRY

(breathing finally)
Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you... you're...
(as it comes to him)
... Aragog, aren't you?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 105.




121A CONTINUED: 121A




Hearing this, Aragog's head turns slightly.

ARAGOG

Hagrid has never sent men into our
hollow before.

HARRY

He's in trouble. Up at school,
there've been attacks. They think
it's Hagrid. They think he's
opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Like before.
As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then...
RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl
slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left.
Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.

ARAGOG

That's a lie! Hagrid never opend
the Chamber of Secrets!

HARRY

But if Hagrid never... that
means... you're not the monster.

ARAGOG

The monster was born in the
castle. I came from a distant
land, in the pocket of a traveler.
Ron turns. TWO CRAWLING SILHOUETTES inch forward.
Pause. Waiting. Watching.

RON

Harry...

HARRY

Shhh!
(to Aragog)
But if you're not the monster,
what did kill that girl fifty
years ago?

ARAGOG

We do not speak of it! It is an
ancient creature we spiders fear
above all others.

HARRY

But have you seen it?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER 0F SECRETS - Rev. 1/28/02 106.




121A CONTINUED: (2) 121A




A SCRABBLING SOUND ECHOES above Ron. He GLANCES UP: a
SPIDER crouches on a branch above.

ARAGOG

I never saw any part of the castle
but the cupboard in which Hagrid
kept me. The girl was discovered
in a bathroom. When I was
accused, Hagrid brought me here.
More SCRABBLING. Ron looks up. We PAN UP with him.
SEE: SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING
DOWNWARD like paratroopers. Ron GRABS Harry.

HARRY

(annoyed)
What!
Ron points. Harry looks. Pales. Turns slowly back to
Aragog.

HARRY

Well... thank you. We'll just
go...

ARAGOG

Go? I think not. My sons and
daughters do not harm Hagrid, on
my command. But I cannot deny
them fresh meat when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.

RON

Can we panic now?
CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! Harry and Ron SPIN. A GANG of
FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead. Begin to move
forward. Harry and Ron SPIN again: SPIDERS.
Everywhere. CLOSING IN.
Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand. The
spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of
the LIGHT chases itself away. Around and around. Then:
The LANTERN goes out.
Harry pitches it aside. As one, he and Ron draw their
wands.

RON

Nice knowing you.

121A CONTINUED: (3) 121A




They're done for. Fang WHIMPERS. The spiders draw
closer, CLICKING FEVERISHLY, when...
... a LONG, LOUD HORN BLEATS. Seconds later, a BLAZE of
LIGHT ignites the hollow and the FORD ANGLIA comes
THUNDERING over the rim and down the slope, KNOCKING
SPIDERS OUT OF ITS PATH. As it SCREECHES to a halt, the

DOORS FLING OPEN.


HARRY

Let's go!
Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY.
A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.

HARRY


THE WINDOWS! ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!


RON

(trying)

I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK!

Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window.
Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE.
Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows
hold tight. As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the
hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his

SPIDER'S LEGS.





121B EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - NIGHT 121B

The Anglia jets out of the hollow, lands with a THUD.
Harry turns. The other spider is PULLING RON from the
car. Harry points his wand, utters a spell and a
BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT BLASTS the spider into the
shadows whipping past.

RON

Thanks for that.

(CONTINUED)

121B CONTINUED: 121B





HARRY

Don't mention it.
They stop. Both hear it: a DISTANT CLICKING. As the
car flies over a ridge, they see them: a SEA OF SPIDERS
heading straight for them like a herd of raging
wildebeest. Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the
wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders
STAMPEDE after.




121C EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - BLACK PARK - NIGHT 121C

The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past
trees as the spiders CHARGE after. Harry peers ahead,
SEES an area of FALLEN TREES. There is an OPENING, one
narrow escape route.

HARRY

That way! It's the only way out!
(looking back)
Hurry! They're catching up!
Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA
drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as
good as dead.

HARRY

Can you get us in the air?

RON

(jostling the
gear stick)
Flying gear's jammed!
The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER. The TARANTULA waits
ahead. Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear
shift, pushing. The tarantula's pincers open, ready to
kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels
LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious
spiders below. The car barely avoids the rearing
tarantula, then sails over the trees.




121D EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT 121D

As they LAND, Fang bolts free. Harry and Ron exit the
CAR wearily, then watch it turn and RUMBLE BACK INTO THE

FOREST.

RON

'Follow the spiders'! Follow the
spiders'! If he ever gets out of
Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I
mean, what was the point of
sending us in there? What have we
found out?

HARRY

We know one thing. Hagrid never
opened the Chamber of Secrets. He
was innocent.

Madam Pomfrey bars the door, frowns at Harry and Ron.

MADAM POMFREY

There's no point in talking to a
petrified person. She won't hear
a word you're saying.
Ron shifts uncomfortably.

RON

We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's
just, well, you see, we thought,
maybe, we could... be with her for
a bit. She's our... friend, you
see, and... even if she can't hear
us... I mean, it can't hurt, can
it?
A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.

MADAM POMFREY

Very well then. But be quick
about it.
As she exits, the boys step to her bed. Absently, Ron
picks up the circular mirror that lies on the nightstand.
Eyes Lockhart's Get Well card.

RON

You don't think Lockhart could be

Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE
AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across
Hermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over her
fingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutched
there.




124 INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (LATER) 124

Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLED
paper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.

HARRY

'Of the many fearsome beasts that
roam our land, none is more deadly
than the Basilisk. Capable of
living for hundreds of years,
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye. Spiders
flee before it and only the
crowing of the rooster can kill
it.'
(looking up)
Ron! This is it! The monster in
the Chamber of Secrets is a
Basilisk. That's why I can hear
it speak. It's a snake.

RON

But it kills by looking people in
the eye. Why is it no one's dead?
Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and
Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite. He mutters

SOFTLY:


HARRY

Because no one did look it in the
eye. Not directly at least...
(in a rush)
Colin saw it through his camera.
Justin -- Justin must've seen the
Basilisk through Nearly Headless
Nick! Nick got the full blast of
it, but he's a ghost -- he
couldn't die again...

corners, in case it came along.

RON

And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure
she didn't have a camera or a
mirror, Harry.

HARRY

The water... there was water on
the floor that night. She only
saw the Basilisk's reflection...
(scanning the
page again)
The crowing of the rooster is
fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's
roosters were killed! Spiders
flee before it! It all fits!

RON

But how's the Basilisk been
getting around? A dirty great
snake. Someone would have seen...

HARRY

Hermione answered that too.
Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is:
"Pipes."

RON

(aghast)
Pipes...? It's using the
plumbing.

HARRY

Remember what Aragog said? About

You wrote them!

GILDEROY LOCKHART

My dear boy, do use your common
sense. My books wouldn't have
sold half as well if people didn't
think I'd done all those things.
No one wants to read about some
ugly old Armenian warlock, even if
he did save a village from
werewolves. He'd look dreadful on
the front cover. No dress sense
at all...

HARRY

You're a fraud! You've just been
taking credit for what a load of
other wizards have done!

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Harry, Harry, Harry. There was
work involved. I had to track
these people down and ask them
exactly how they managed to do
what they did. No, it's not all
book signings and publicity
photos. You want fame, you have
to be prepared for a long, hard
slog.

RON

Is there anything you can do?

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Yes, now that you mention it. I'm
rather gifted with Memory Charms.
Otherwise, you see, all those
wizards would've gone blabbing and
I'd never have sold another book.
I'm afraid I'll have to do the
same to you both, lest you do the
same.
Lockhart lifts his wand, but Harry is quicker.

128 CONTINUED: (2) 128





HARRY

Expelliarmus!
Lockhart BLASTS backwards, toppling into one of the open
trunks, his wand flying across the floor.

HARRY

Looks like those Dueling Lessons
came in handy after all,
Professor.

130 INT. GIRLS' BATHROOM - NIGHT 130

Lockhart walks ahead of Harry and Ron, their wands
pointed at him. Moaning Myrtle floats above the cistern.

MOANING MYRTLE

Who's there? Oh...
(smiles, flirty)
Hello, Harry. What do you want?

HARRY

To ask you how you died.

MOANING MYRTLE

(flattered)
Oooooh, it was dreadful. It
happened right here. In this very
cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive
Hornby was teasing me about my
glasses. I was crying, and then I
heard somebody come in.

HARRY

Who was it, Myrtle?

MOANING MYRTLE

I don't know! I was distraught!
But they said something funny. A
kind of made-up language. And I
realized it was a boy speaking.
So I unlocked the door, to tell
him to go away, and... I died.

HARRY

Just like that? How?

(CONTINUED)





117.





130 CONTINUED: 130





MOANING MYRTLE

No idea. I just remember seeing a
pair of great big yellow eyes.
Over there...



Myrtle points to the bank of sinks. Harry and Ron hurry
over, examining the pipes below, the tile above, then...
Harry sees it: etched on one of the COPPER TAPS is a

TINY SNAKE.


HARRY

This is it, Ron. This is the
entrance to the Chamber of
Secrets.

RON

Say something, Harry. Say
something in Parseltongue.
Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.

HARRY

Open up.
Ron shakes his head. Harry's spoken in his regular
voice.

RON

English.
Harry concentrates harder this time, staring so intensely
that the snake almost looks alive. When, finally, he
speaks, it is more like a HISS. Parseltongue. The
circular group of sinks OPEN and a LARGE, OPEN PIPE is
exposed.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well then. I'll just be going.
There's no need for me...

HARRY

Oh, yes there is. You first.
Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Now, boys. What good will it do?

RON

A bloody lot of good if it's a
two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged
rocks.

(CONTINUED)





118.





130 CONTINUED: (2) 130




Lockhart steps grimly to the dark, gaping hole. Ron
gives him a shove and he topples headfirst and out of
sight. They wait. Finally...




GILDEROY LOCKHART (O.S.)

It's really quite filthy down
here.

HARRY

All right. Let's go.

MOANING MYRTLE

Oh, Harry... if you die down
there, you're welcome to share my
toilet.

HARRY

Thanks, Myrtle.
Harry turns. Jumps. Seconds later, Ron follows.




131 INT. PIPE - NIGHT 131

Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raising
vertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smaller
pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and
turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the
damp floor of a stone tunnel.




132 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT 132

Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from his
robes. Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises his
wand.

HARRY

Lumos!
The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.

HARRY

Remember. Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straight away.
Harry leads the way down the tunnel. CRUNCH! They look
down: a rat's skull. All around them, the ground is
littered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, sees
something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks,
his voice is hollow with dread.

(CONTINUED)





119.





132 CONTINUED: 132





RON

What's that? Up ahead?

GILDEROY LOCKHART

That looks like a... snake.
Terrified, Lockhart quickly HIDES HIS EYES.

HARRY

Maybe it's asleep.
Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harry
shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY

SKIN.


RON

Bloody hell. Whatever shed this
must be twenty feet long. Or
more.
THUD! They turn. Lockhart has passed out.

RON

Heart of a lion, this one.
Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and,
quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to
his feet.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

The adventure ends here, boys!
But don't fret. The world will
know our story. How I was too
late to save the girl. How you
two tragically lost your minds at
the sight of her mangled body.
I'll even bind a limited edition
in this snake skin. Say goodbye
to your memories.
(raising Ron's wand)
Obliviate!
Ron's WAND EXPLODES like a small BOMB, BLASTING Lockhart
OFF HIS FEET and SPITTING great JETS of FIRE into the
rock above. As RUBBLE RAINS, Ron LEAPS one way and Harry
the other. Harry sits up, squints through the settling
dust. A SOLID WALL of BROKEN ROCK seals the tunnel
between him and Ron. INTERCUT Harry and Ron.

HARRY

Ron? Are you okay?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/19/02 120.




132 CONTINUED: (2) 132





RON

I'm okay. This git's not, though.
He got blasted by my wand.



Lockhart sits up, dazed. Ron picks up a rock and CONKS
him on the head. Lockhart PASSES OUT. Ron calls to
Harry.

RON

What now?

HARRY

Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go
on and... find Ginny. If I'm not
back in an hour...
He leaves it there.

RON

I'll try and shift some of this
rock. So you can get back
through. And, Harry --

HARRY

See you in a bit.
Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off.
He steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches a
TOWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.

HARRY

(Parseltongue)
Open.
The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN. Harry
removes his wand and ENTERS.




133 INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT 133

A vast chamber stretches ahead. Along the path are rows
of STONE SERPENTS. The serpents rest in pools of black
water. Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN.
Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies
motionless. As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms,
her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble. A
pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest.
Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on
the floor and kneels beside her. (BOLD ITALICS INDICATE

POSSIBLE FLASHBACKS.)


HARRY

Ginny! Please don't be dead.
Wake up! Wake up!
Ginny!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/19/02 121.




133 CONTINUED: 133





TOM RIDDLE

She won't wake.
Harry spins. Tom Riddle stands nearby. He is strangely
BLURRED around the edges, as though Harry was looking at
him through a misted window.

HARRY

Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you
mean, she won't wake? She's
not...

TOM RIDDLE

She's still alive. But only just.

HARRY

Are you a ghost?

TOM RIDDLE

A memory. Preserved in a diary
for fifty years.
Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's hand, then places his
own hand on Ginny's arm.

HARRY

She's cold as ice. You've got
to help me, Tom. There's a
basilisk --

TOM RIDDLE

It won't come until it's called.
Harry looks up, sees Riddle twirling a wand in his
fingers.

HARRY

Give me my wand, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE

You won't be needing it.

HARRY

Listen, we've got to go! We've
got to save her!

TOM RIDDLE

I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry.
You see, as poor Ginny grows
weaker... I grow stronger.

HARRY

But she's dying!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/19/02 122.




133 CONTINUED: (2) 133





TOM RIDDLE

Yes. I'm afraid so. But then,
she's been in so much pain, poor
Ginny. She's been writing to me
for months, telling me all her
pitiful worries and woes. Ginny
poured her soul out to me. I grew
stronger on a diet of her deepest
fears, her darkest secrets. I
grew powerful enough to start
feeding Ginny a few secrets, to
start pouring a bit of my soul
back into her...
Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins
cruelly.

TOM RIDDLE

Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

HARRY

No... she couldn't -- she
wouldn't.

TOM RIDDLE

It was Ginny who set the Basilisk
on the Mudbloods and the Squib's
cat. Ginny who wrote threatening
messages on the walls.

HARRY

But... Why?...

TOM RIDDLE

Because I told her to. You'll
find that I can be very
persuasive. Not that she knew
what she was doing. She was,
shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her and she tried
to dispose of it in the girls'
bathroom. But then, who should
find it... but you. The very
person I was most anxious to meet.

HARRY

(getting angry)
And why did you want to meet me?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/19/02 123.




133 CONTINUED: (3) 133





TOM RIDDLE

Ginny told me all about you. I
knew I had to talk to you, meet
you if I could. So I decided to
show you my capture of that
brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain
your trust.

HARRY

Hagrid's my friend. And you
framed him, didn't you?

TOM RIDDLE

It was my word against Hagrid's.
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
Hagrid was innocent.

HARRY

I'll bet Dumbledore saw right
through you.

TOM RIDDLE

I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
the Chamber again while I was
still at school. So I decided to
leave behind a diary, preserving
my sixteen-year-old self in its
pages, so that one day... I would
be able to lead another to finish
Salazar Slytherin's noble work.

HARRY

Well, you haven't finished it this
time. In a few hours Mandrake
Draught will be ready and everyone
who was petrified will be all
right again.

TOM RIDDLE

Haven't I told you, that killing
Mudbloods doesn't matter to me
anymore? For many months now, my
new target has been... you.
(grinning)
Imagine my disappointment when I
learned Ginny had stolen the diary
back from you.

HARRY

Ginny stole the diary from my
room? But why?

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/19/02 124.




133 CONTINUED: (4) 133





TOM RIDDLE

She was afraid. Afraid you'd
learn how to work the diary.
Afraid I'd tell you just who it
was that had been strangling all
those roosters.
Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE,
then back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.

TOM RIDDLE

Come now, Harry. Don't look so
disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded
in destroying the diary, she would
have destroyed me. And we
couldn't be having this little
talk. And I have so many
questions for you.

HARRY

Like what?

TOM RIDDLE

Well, how is it that a baby with
no extraordinary magical talent
managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you
escape with nothing but a scar,
while Lord Voldemort's powers were
destroyed?

HARRY

Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

TOM RIDDLE

Voldemort is my past, present and
future.
Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to
trace it through the air, writing three words: "TOM
MARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them:

"I AM LORD VOLDEMORT."


HARRY

You. You're the heir of
Slytherin. You're Voldemort?

TOM RIDDLE

Surely you didn't think I would
keep my filthy Muggle father's
name?

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/19/02 125.




133 CONTINUED: (5) 133





TOM RIDDLE (CONT'D)

No, I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere
would one day fear to speak, when
I became the greatest sorcerer in
the world.

HARRY

Albus Dumbledore is the greatest
sorcerer in the world!

TOM RIDDLE

Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of
me.

HARRY

He'll never be gone! Not as long
as those who remain are loyal to
him!
Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep
within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over
the rock. Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix. The
bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE
in its golden talons.

HARRY

Fawkes.
Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which
is the SORTING HAT, at his feet. Riddle picks it up.

TOM RIDDLE

(giggling)
This is what Dumbledore sends his
defender! A songbird and an old
hat!
Riddle tosses aside the hat. He turns to the statue of
Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.

TOM RIDDLE

(Parseltongue)
Speak to me, Slytherin.
Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS. There is a
RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING.
Harry turns away. The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills
out, uncoiling heavily to the floor. Harry turns to the
wall. The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall.
PAN TO Tom Riddle, looking at Harry.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/21/02 126.




133 CONTINUED: (6) 133





TOM RIDDLE

Let's match the powers of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar
Slytherin, against the famous
Harry Potter, shall we?
Riddle turns, to serpent, speaking in Parseltongue.

TOM RIDDLE

(Parseltongue)
Kill him!
The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward. Harry turns, RUNS away.

TOM RIDDLE

Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me.

HARRY

(to himself)
Don't look. Don't look into its
eyes.
Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent
is FASTER. Harry TRIPS. FALLS. The Basilisk RISES.
Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike.
Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk
and circling its blunt head, confusing it. The SNAKE
SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife,
driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering
eyes.
As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall,
the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain. Fawkes wings away,
its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS:
the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.

TOM RIDDLE

Fool! Think you're safe! It can
still hear you!
As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING
BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE.
Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about to
strike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDE

TUNNEL.





133A INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT 133A

Harry RACES HEADLONG into the shadows, then looks back,
sees the snake eclipse the light at the far end of the
tunnel and SLITHER QUICKLY inside.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 2/19/02 126A.




133A CONTINUED: 133A




Thinking, Harry DUCKS INTO AN ALCOVE, puts his hand over
his mouth and waits, desperate to remain STILL and
SILENT. The snake slides heavily by, then... SLOWS.

TURNS BACK.




The snake's head weaves inside, only INCHES from Harry's
face. Harry trembles as the snake's head cocks to the
side, then... finally... WITHDRAWS.




133B INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT 133B

Harry DASHES back into the main chamber. Ginny looks
frighteningly pale. Riddle GRINS cruelly, almost SOLID
now.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 127.




133B CONTINUED: 133B





TOM RIDDLE

Yes, Potter. The process is
nearly complete. In a few
minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead. And I will cease to be a
memory. Lord Voldemort will
return. Very much... alive.
Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK
SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of
Harry. Trapped, Harry glances around, then --
impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue
of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent strikes madly, but
Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
top. He turns. Sees the Sorting Hat. Sees what
glitters within: the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD.
Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing
serpent like St. George and the dragon. In a mad rush of
courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN
its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED. Too tired to flee,
Harry simply waits. The serpent rises and, FANGS

BARED... STRIKES.

Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry
drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the
SERPENT'S mouth. It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as
it drives a FANG into Harry's arm. Harry clutches his
arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor,
watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes

STILL.

Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the
blood soaking slowly into his robe. As he yanks the fang
free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now. His
eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.

TOM RIDDLE

Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly
the venom of the Basilisk
penetrates the body? If you have
any final words, Potter, you'd
best speak them now. I'd guess
you have little more than a minute
to live.
Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearm
turns a troubling gray.

(CONTINUED)

133B CONTINUED: (1A) 133B





TOM RIDDLE

So ends the famous Harry Potter.
On his knees in the Chamber of
Secrets. Defeated at last by the
Dark Lord he so unwisely
challenged. You'll be back with
your dear Mudblood mother soon,
Harry...
As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly white
now, a small ghost, the only evidence of life the
TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER. Harry studies the finger
and what lies beneath it: Tom Riddle's diary. Harry
begins to crawl toward her.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/16/02 128.




133B CONTINUED: (2) 133B





TOM RIDDLE

Funny, isn't it? The damage a
silly little book can do?
Especially in the hands of a silly
little girl.
As Harry reaches Ginny, he places his hand on hers,
then... slips the diary free.

TOM RIDDLE

What are you doing? No. Stop...
Riddle's face creases in fear. He LUNGES FORWARD. But
Harry is too quick. Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES
THE FANG into the book. Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from
the pages.

TOM RIDDLE

No!
Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain. His body begins to
wither instantly, growing BLURRY once more. As the ink
runs off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHES
altogether. Harry sinks back, then... hears a FAINT
MOAN. Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks. As she
sees Harry, she SOBS.

GINNY

Harry. It was me! But I swear, I
didn't mean to... Riddle made me.
He wrote to me... took me over...
I didn't even know whose diary it
was. I found it inside my
cauldron. The day we all went to
Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're
hurt...

HARRY

Ginny. You need to get yourself
out... Follow the chamber...
You'll find Ron...
There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays
his head onto Harry's arm.

HARRY

You were brilliant, Fawkes. I
just... wasn't quick enough.
Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS are
trickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm. Almost
instantly, his wound... begins to heal itself.

(CONTINUED)





129.





133B CONTINUED: (3) 133B





HARRY

Of course. Dumbledore told me.
Phoenix tears have healing powers.
(looking up at Ginny)
It's all right, Ginny. It's over.
It's just a memory...




134 INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT (LATER) 134

With Fawkes gliding gracefully ahead of them, Harry and
Ginny make their way back. Up ahead, SHIFTING ROCK can
be heard and a jagged fissure of LIGHT GLIMMERS. Ron's
face appears.

RON

Ginny!
Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.

RON

You're alive. I can't believe it.

GINNY

I'm going to be expelled, I just
know it!

RON

(to Harry)
Remind you of anyone?

HARRY

Where's Lockhart?
Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMING
placidly.

RON

His Memory Charm backfired.
Hasn't got a clue who he is. I
keep having to stop him wandering
off. He's a danger to himself.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Hello. Odd sort of place, this,
isn't it? Do you live here?

RON

No.
Ron turns, raises his eyebrows at Harry. Harry looks
upward. There is an opening, hundreds of feet up. Just
then, Fawkes circles back, fluttering in front of Harry.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/16/02 130.




134 CONTINUED: 134





RON

What's with the bird?

HARRY

I think... I think he's telling me
he can take us out of here.




134A INT. ROCKY TUNNEL - NIGHT (LATER) 134A

A CURIOUS, GLIDING SHADOW RIPPLES across the cavernous
wall, and then Harry, Ron, Ginny and Lockhart soar out of
the darkness, linked hand in hand. Fawkes is flying them
home.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Amazing! This is just like magic!




134B OMITTED 134B





135 INT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY 135

Harry and Ron, covered in muck and slime -- stand in
Dumbledore's office. Fawkes perches on a pedestal behind
Dumbledore, who sits at his desk, examining the charred
diary. He looks up, regarding Harry and Ron gravely.

DUMBLEDORE

Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.
(looking up)
Of course, Tom Riddle was probably
the most brilliant student
Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught
him myself fifty years ago. After
he left, I would occasionally hear
stories of his activities -- dark
rumors -- but after awhile, even
the rumors stopped. When he
finally resurfaced as Lord
Voldemort, most people had
completely forgotten the clever
Head Boy he'd once been.

GINNY

I didn't know whose diary it was,
sir. I swear. I found it inside
my cauldron.
(to the others)
The day we all went to Diagon
Alley.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/17/02 131.




135 CONTINUED: 135




Hearing this, Harry frowns in thought, recollecting...

GINNY

But I understand if... given all
the trouble I've caused... if
you --

DUMBLEDORE

Wiser wizards than you have been
hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss
Weasley. No, I think you've
endured enough. I would suggest a
bit of bed rest, however. And
perhaps a large mug of hot
chocolate. I always find that
cheers me up. Minerva, will you
show Arthur and Molly up to the
hospital wing?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Certainly, Albus.
As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go. Mrs.
Weasley's VOICE carries:

MRS. WEASLEY

A diary that writes back to you!
Honestly, Ginny! What were you
thinking? Haven't I always told
you? Never trust anything that
can think for itself if you can't
see where it keeps its brain!
Harry and Ron turn back. See Dumbledore regarding them
gravely.

DUMBLEDORE

You two realize, of course, that
in the last few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school
rules?

HARRY/RON

Yes, sir.

DUMBLEDORE

And that there is sufficient
evidence to expel you both?

HARRY/RON

Yes, sir.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/17/02 131A.




135 CONTINUED: (1A) 135





DUMBLEDORE

Therefore, it seems only
fitting...
(eyes twinkling)
That you both receive Special
Awards for Services to the School.
And -- let me see -- yes, I think
two hundred points apiece, which,
I believe, should be more than
enough to secure Gryffindor the
House Cup.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/16/02 132.




135 CONTINUED: (2) 135





HARRY/RON

(grinning)
Thank you, sir.




DUMBLEDORE

Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would,
have an owl deliver these release
papers to Azkaban. We need our
gamekeeper back.
Ron nods, takes the envelope and exits.

DUMBLEDORE

First, Harry, I want to thank you.
You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber.
Nothing but that could have called
Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense
you're troubled by something. Am
I right?

HARRY

It's just, you see, sir, I
couldn't help noticing certain
things. Certain similarities.
Between Tom Riddle and me.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 3/1/02 133.




135 CONTINUED: (3) 135





DUMBLEDORE

You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,
because Lord Voldemort can speak
Parseltongue. Unless I'm much
mistaken, he transformed some of
his own powers to you the night he
gave you that scar.

HARRY

Voldemort put a bit of himself in
me?

DUMBLEDORE

Not intentionally, but... yes.

HARRY

So the Sorting Hat was right. I
should be a Slytherin.

DUMBLEDORE

It's true, Harry. You do possess
many of the qualities Voldemort
himself prizes. Resourcefulness.
Determination. A certain
disregard for the rules. Yet the
Sorting Hat placed you in
Gryffindor.

HARRY

Only because I asked it to.

DUMBLEDORE

Exactly. Which makes you very
different from Voldemort. It's
not our abilities that show what
we truly are, Harry. It's our
choices.
(smiling at him)
If you want proof that you belong
in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest
you look more closely at this.
Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry. An
ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.

HARRY

'Godric Gryffindor.'

DUMBLEDORE

Only a true Gryffindor could have
pulled that out of the Hat.

Suddenly, Lucius Malfoy enters, dragging... Dobby by the
ear.

HARRY

Dobby! This is your Master? The
family you serve is the Malfoys!
Dobby nods, chagrined. Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Out of my way, Potter.
(to Dumbledore)
So! You've returned!

DUMBLEDORE

Yes. When the governors heard
that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
been taken into the Chamber, they
saw fit to summon me back.
(a wry smile)
Curiously, several of them seemed
under the impression that you
would curse their families if they
didn't agree to suspend me in the
first place, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY

From the beginning, my only
concern has been the welfare of
this school and its students.
I assume the culprit has been
identified.

DUMBLEDORE

Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only
this time, he chose to act through
someone else. By means of...
this.
As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy,
Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to
Lucius.

DUMBLEDORE

Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.
(a chill to his voice)
One only hopes that no more of
Lord Voldemort's old school things
find their way into innocent
hands. The consequences for the
one responsible could be...
severe.

135 CONTINUED: (5) 135




Lucius Malfoy stares icily at Dumbledore, then turns
away.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
As Dobby scuttles toward the door, Lucius Malfoy KICKS
HIM through it, then exits himself. Harry stares at the
empty doorway as DOBBY'S PAINFUL SQUEALS ECHO from the
corridor.

HARRY

Sir? I wonder if I could have
that.
Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary.




135A EXT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 135A

As the elevator opens, Harry dashes out.

HARRY

Mr. Malfoy! I have something of
yours.
Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy's
hand.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Mine? I don't know what you're
talking about.

HARRY

I think you do, sir. I think you
slipped it into Ginny Weasley's
cauldron that day in Diagon Alley.
Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans
close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:

LUCIUS MALFOY

Prove it!
He turns away. As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching the
diary in his hand, Harry mouths the words: Open it.
Dobby looks down curiously. Inside... is a SOCK. He

GASPS.


LUCIOUS MALFOY

Dobby!
Dobby, come!

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/3/02 136.




135A CONTINUED: 135A





DOBBY

(in wonderment)
Master has given Dobby a sock.
Master has presented Dobby with
clothes. Dobby is... free!

LUCIUS MALFOY

What? I didn't --
He wheels, sees Harry standing with one leg crossed: His
right ankle is bare. Instantly, Malfoy charges forth.

LUCIUS MALFOY

You've lost me my servant!

DOBBY

You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Dobby steps between and -- BANG! Malfoy flies backwards,
lands in a crumpled heap. Rising, he stares murderously
at Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Mark my words, Harry Potter.
You'll meet the same sticky end as
your parents one of these days.
They were meddlesome fools too.
With that, he turns, storms off.

DOBBY

Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can
Dobby ever repay him?

HARRY

Just promise me something.

DOBBY

Anything, sir.

HARRY

Never try to save my life again.
Dobby grins then and -- CRACK! -- is gone.

137 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 137

Fear and suspicion banished, the House tables abuzz with
excitement and anticipation... all except the Slytherins,
who do not share the general feeling.

(CONTINUED)




THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev. 4/3/02 137.




137 CONTINUED: 137




Seated at the tables, are the formerly petrified, revived
students. Justin Finch-Fletchley joins his fellow
Hufflepuffs. Colin Creevey SNAPS photos of the
proceedings.



At the rear of the hall, standing near the entrance,
Filch is reunited with Mrs. Norris. Then... Hermione
enters, searching the room for Harry and Ron. Finally,
she sees them. Smiles. Runs forward and embraces Harry.

HERMIONE

You solved it! You solved it!

HARRY

With loads of help from you.
She turns to embrace Ron. They pause, an awkward moment
between them and... shake hands instead.

RON

Welcome back, Hermione.
McGonagall taps her goblet. Dumbledore stands.

DUMBLEDORE

Before we begin our feast, let's
give a round of applause to
Professor Sprout and Madame
Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has
been successfully administered to
all those who had been petrified.
Everyone applauds.

DUMBLEDORE

Also, in the wake of recent
events, as a school treat, all
exams have been cancelled.
Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.

HERMIONE

Oh, no!
At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN. It's
Hagrid. He enters. Stops. Looks around. The room
falls SILENT. All eyes upon him. He glances around.
Nervous. Embarrassed.

HAGRID

Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin'
my release papers got all lost 'n
confused. Some ruddy bird named
Errol.

(CONTINUED)

Ron exchanges a nervous glance with Dumbledore. Hagrid
looks at all of the faces staring at him. He turns to
Harry.




HAGRID

I jus' want to say... that if it
wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an'
Ron... and Hermione... Well, I
jus' want to say... Thanks.

HARRY

There's no Hogwarts without you,
Hagrid.
Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly...
brings his hands together. The others join him. Soon,
everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING. As the
students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes,
and...
CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the
celebration. WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a
WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the
night.




FADE TO BLACK.









CHAPTER 3


FADE IN:
1 EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 1
The street slumbers, adrift in shadow. Then... a curious
BEAM OF LIGHT BOBS beyond the second-story window of
Number Four.
2 INT. HARRY’S ROOM - SAME TIME - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 2
A tent of blankets. Within... the SHADOW of a BOY. A
WHISPER:
HARRY
Lumos Maxima...
The tent BLOOMS SOFTLY with light -- briefly illuminating
a bedside PHOTOGRAPH (of James & Lily Potter) -- then
goes dark.
HARRY
Lumos Maxima...
The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a
TOILET FLUSHES. Instantly, the SHADOW stiffens, the
blankets DIM, and the tent flattens. Just as...
... the bedroom door OPENS, revealing... UNCLE VERNON.
He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then...
withdraws.
The tent rises.
HARRY
Lumos Maxima...
As the blankets blaze, we CUT INSIDE, find a SKINNY BOY
with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting
crookedly atop his nose: HARRY POTTER. Open before him
is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he
speaks:
HARRY
Lumos... MAXIMA!
2A EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 2A
A BLINDING BLAST OF LIGHT FLASHES from the second story
window of Number Four. DOGS BARK. And a TITLE CARD
appears:
HARRY POTTER
and the
Prisoner of Azkaban

2B INT. HARRY’S ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 2B
The light in the hallway SNAPS on, Harry's tent droops
once more and, seconds later, Harry's door eases open.
Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. The
room is utterly SILENT. Slowly, he closes the door.

6 INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - STAIRWAY/FRONT HALL - DAY 6
The DOORBELL CHIMES and a shrill VOICE THUNDERS:
AUNT PETUNIA (O.S.)
Harry!
Harry!
Harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall,
where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly.
Petunia flicks a bit of fluff from Dudley's sweater,
glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the
door.
AUNT PETUNIA
Well, go on. Open it.
Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS
OPEN, revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and
a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle Vernon lurches
forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in
hand, and drops it on Harry.
AUNT PETUNIA
Marge! Welcome! How was the
train?
AUNT MARGE
Wretched. Ripper got sick.
AUNT PETUNIA
Ah. How... unfortunate.
AUNT MARGE
I would've left him with the
others, but he pines so when I'm
away. Don't you, darling?
Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down
the hallway. Harry follows with Uncle Vernon.
(CONTINUED)

HARRY
Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign
this form.
UNCLE VERNON
What is it?
HARRY
Nothing. Something for school...
Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in Harry's hand
suspiciously.
UNCLE VERNON
Later perhaps. If you behave.
HARRY
I will if she does.
AUNT MARGE
(turning, eyeing Harry)
So. Still here, are you?
HARRY
Yes.
AUNT MARGE
Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful
tone. Damn good of my brother to
keep you, if you ask me.
(to Vernon, Petunia)
It'd have been straight to an
orphanage if he'd been dumped on
my doorstep.
Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV --
emits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.
AUNT MARGE
Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that
my neffy poo? Come and say hello
to your Auntie Marge.
Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks,
waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently.
Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his
ankle.
7 INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DINING ROOM - DUSK 7
As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a
bottle of brandy.

UNCLE VERNON
Can I tempt you, Marge?
AUNT MARGE
Just a small one. A bit more... a
bit more... That's the boy.
(taking a
sloppy sip)
Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia.
It's normally just a fry-up for
me, what with twelve dogs.
She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Ripper
take a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catches
Harry looking.
AUNT MARGE
What are you smirking at! Where
is it that you send him, Vernon?
UNCLE VERNON
St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases.
Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who
glares darkly at him.
AUNT MARGE
I see. And do they use the cane
at St. Brutus's, boy?
HARRY
(sarcastically)
Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads
of times.
AUNT MARGE
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense
about not hitting people who
deserve it.
(another sip)
Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
how this one's turned out, Vernon.
It all comes down to blood. Bad
blood will out. What is it the
boy's father did, Petunia?
AUNT PETUNIA
(agitated)
Nothing. That is... he didn't
work. He was -- unemployed.
(CONTINUED)
6.
7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
AUNT MARGE
Of course. And a drunk,
I expect --
HARRY
That's a lie.
Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.
AUNT MARGE
What did you say?
HARRY
My dad wasn't a drunk.
POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.
AUNT PETUNIA
Oh my goodness! Marge!
AUNT MARGE
Not to worry, Petunia. I have a
very firm grip.
Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise.
UNCLE VERNON
You go to bed. Now.
AUNT MARGE
Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter
about the father. In the end it
comes down to the mother. You see
it all the time with dogs. If
there's something wrong with the
bitch, there'll be something wrong
with the pup...
HARRY
Shut up! Shut up!
Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON on
her dress sails into the air. SEAMS GROAN. THREAD
SNAPS. Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN. Her cheeks BILLOW. Her
whole body BILLOWS. And she begins to INFLATE like a
MONSTROUS BALLOON.
UNCLE VERNON
MARGE!
As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her. RIPPER GROWLS,
fixes his teeth to his trousers. Harry frightened by
what he's done, watches Aunt Marge BOUNCE GENTLY across
the ceiling and into the CONSERVATORY.
7.
7A EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 7A
The others race outside. As Aunt Marge begins to float
away, Uncle Vernon grips her hands.
UNCLE VERNON
Don't worry! I've got you...
Slowly... to his horror... Uncle Vernon himself begins to
RISE. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes...
AUNT MARGE
Vernon. Don't you dare --
But he does. He lets go. Falls to his knees. And
watches Aunt Marge float away.
8 INT. HARRY’S ROOM - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 8
Harry crashes inside, takes his TRUNK, then puts his heel
to a LOOSE FLOORBOARD and removes his WAND from its
hiding place. Turning, he grabs the PHOTOGRAPH of his
parents.
9 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the TRUNK down the
stairs... finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him.
UNCLE VERNON
YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER
BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!
HARRY
No! She deserved what she got!
And you... you keep away from me.
Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with
knowing cruelty.
UNCLE VERNON
You're not allowed to do magic out
of school. They won't have you
now. You've got nowhere to go.
Harry realizes it's true. Briefly falters. Then:
HARRY
Anywhere's better than here.
9A EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9A
As Harry storms out with his trunk, we DOLLY TO the
street WITH him. High in the sky, a plump DOT rises.
Aunt Marge.
8.
10 EXT. MAGNOLIA CRESCENT - NIGHT (LATER) 10
Harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops. Glances
about. An empty PLAYGROUND. SWINGS CREAKING gently on
rusted chains. A tiny CAROUSEL, kissed gently by the
wind, turning slowly.
Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Deep in the night, an
ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT. Harry, still as a statue.
Listening. In the trees above, LEAVES TREMBLE. The WIND
gathers.
Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.
Then, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something in
the shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draws
his wand.
Then he sees... it. Something BIG. Darker than the
shadows which conceal it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING
EYES.
Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Afraid not to. Wand
outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten
trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES.
BANG! TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night.
HARRY
Aaaah!
GIANT WHEELS bear down. Harry rolls clear -- just as a
PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a
halt. GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the windscreen: The
Knight Bus.
DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18-
year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty
face. Raccoon eyes. Stan looks like he hasn't seen the
sun in years.
STAN SHUNPIKE
(wearily, drearily)
Welcome to the Knight Bus.
Emergency transport for the
stranded witch or wizard. My name
is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this evening.
(peering at Harry)
Wha' choo doin' down there?
HARRY
Fell over.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Wha' choo fall over for?
(CONTINUED)

10 CONTINUED: 10
HARRY
I didn't do it on purpose.
Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Well, come on then. Let's not
wait for the grass to grow.
As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows
across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs
aboard.
11 INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 11
No seats. Only BEDS. The BRASS frames need a shine, the
lines a wash. In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS,
turns over in his sleep.
DISHEVELED WIZARD
Not now... I'm pickling slugs...
Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK
GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with
sweat. A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror,
MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace its
mouth.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Take 'er away, Ern.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Yeah, take it away!
BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide
six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed
nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly
above his head. Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC
WHIPS past in a blur.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Wot you say your name was again?
HARRY
I didn't.
Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily
Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once
more. Harry brushes the fringe of his hair over his
scar, watches an AMBULANCE -- SIREN WAILING -- careen
past.
(CONTINUED)
10.
11 CONTINUED: 11
STAN SHUNPIKE
Whereabouts you headin'?
Harry hesitates. He hadn't thought about this. Decides.
HARRY
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in
London --
STAN SHUNPIKE
Is it now? Get that, Ern? The
Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from
the pea soup!
As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers
out the windscreen, watches London careering by.
HARRY
Isn't this a bit... dangerous?
STAN SHUNPIKE
Naah. Haven't had an accident
in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Heads up! Little old lady at
twelve o'clock!
Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is
crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and
Harry flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes
pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and
Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets
forward once more.
As Harry rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of
Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a
sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a
MOVING PHOTOGRAPH.
HARRY
Who is that? That man.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Who is that? That's Sirius Black,
that is. Don' tell me you ne'er
been hearin' o' Sirius Black?
(CONTINUED)
11.
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face.
STAN SHUNPIKE
A murderer, he is. Got 'imself
locked up in Azkaban for it.
HARRY
How'd he escape?
STAN SHUNPIKE
Tha's the question, isn't it?
He's the firs' that's done it.
Gives me the collywobbles thinking
he's out there, though, I'll tell
you that. Big supporter of YouKnow-'Oo,
Black was. Reckon you
heard o' him.
Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Meet
Harry's.
HARRY
Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly
toward the Knight Bus. Before can scream, the entire
Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the
two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Hate that.
HARRY
This bus. Don't the Muggles ever...
STAN SHUNPIKE
Them! Don' listen properly, do
they? Don' look properly either.
Never notice nuffink, they don'.
Just then, a COUPLE walking a DOG are engulfed by a RUSH
of WIND as the (invisible) Knight Bus WHOOSHES past. The
couple glances about in bewilderment. The DOG YAPS
madly.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Turn! Turn!
Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a
dizzying 360-degree turn. HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the
windows as the bus rides up on two wheels and Harry is
sent flying once more. Grabbing fast to the center POLE,
he pirouettes through the air when Ernie... SLAMS on the
BRAKES.
12.
12 EXT. CHARING CROSS ROAD/LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT 12
The Knight Bus fishtails INTO VIEW and SQUEALS to a stop,
centimeters from a PARKED CAR. WHOOSH! The bus settles
and -- TINK! -- taps the bumper. Instantly, the car's
ALARM wails.
12A INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 12A
The chandelier sways drunkenly as the bus doors open.
The steps GROAN with heavy feet and a FIGURE appears:
TOM, Innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron pub.
TOM
Mr. Potter... at last.
12B EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 12B
As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are
revealed, Harry glances up, reads the SIGN above: THE
LEAKY CAULDRON. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then
pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car
alarm.
13 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BAR/HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS 13
LATER)
Harry trails Tom through the quiet room. The BARTENDER
glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A
solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his
COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF. Tom leads Harry upstairs.
14 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BACK ROOM - NIGHT 14
As Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a SNOW WHITE OWL
(HEDWIG) perched atop a chair.
HARRY
Hedwig!
TOM
Right smart bird you've got there,
Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes
before yourself.
A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED
SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE) at the window, staring at
the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers
in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a
position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his
palms.
(CONTINUED)
13.
14 CONTINUED: 14
CORNELIUS FUDGE
I should tell you, Mr. Potter,
earlier this evening your uncle's
sister was located just south of
Sheffield, circling a chimney
stack. The Accidental Magic
Reversal Department was dispatched
and she's been properly punctured
and
her memory modified. She has no
recollection of the incident
whatsoever.
Harry waits. A man condemned. Then Fudge turns.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
So that's that, and no harm done.
(smiling)
Pea soup?
Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to
Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut
sliver.
HARRY
No thank you. Minister... I don't
understand. I broke the law.
Underage wizards aren't allowed to
use magic at home --
CORNELIUS FUDGE
(dishing up a bowl)
Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban for
blowing up their aunts! On the
other hand... running away like
that... given the state of
things... very, very
irresponsible.
HARRY
'The state of things' sir?
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.
HARRY
Sirius Black, you mean. But...
what's that got to do with me?
CRACK! Tom SHATTERS another WALNUT. Fudge smiles
nervously.
(CONTINUED)
14.
14 CONTINUED: (2) 14
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Hm? Oh, nothing. You're safe,
that's what matters. Tomorrow
you'll be on your way to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them
brought here for you.
Harry eyes the STACK of BOOKS. One is bound by a ROPE.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
By the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here it would be best if you
didn't... wander.

16 EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING 16
THROUGH the window: the rooftops of London. A TRAIN
PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Harry, standing
with Hedwig. He turns, eyes his schoolbooks. He studies
the GROWLING TOME -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then
gives the rope a tug. Instantly...
... the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers
SNAPPING. Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins
NIPPING viciously at his shoes. Harry vaults atop the
bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a
PILLOW.
Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry
POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled
beneath the pillow. Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to
rebind it.
17 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - HALLWAY/ROOMELEVEN - MORNING 17
A YOUNG WITCH in maid's robes pushes a cart down the
hall. Harry exits his room as the witch KNOCKS on a
door.
YOUNG WITCH
Housekeeping.
As she opens the door, she's greeted by a THUNDEROUS ROAR
and a RUSH of WIND.
YOUNG WITCH
(unperturbed)
I'll come back later.

RON (O.S.)
I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep
that bloody beast of yours away
from Scabbers or I'll turn it into
a tea cozy.
HERMIONE (O.S.)
He's a cat, Ronald! What do you
expect? It's in his nature.
As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY
protectively cradling Scabbers, while HERMIONE GRANDER
does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks.
RON
A cat! Is that what they told
you? Looks more like a pig with
hair if you ask me.
HERMIONE
That's rich coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.
(cooing to the cat)
It's all right, Crookshanks. You
just ignore the mean little boy...
Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.

As Ron smoothes the dog-eared clipping onto the table,
Harry studies it. Hermione ignores it, stroking
Crookshanks.
HARRY
Egypt! What's it like?
RON
Brilliant. It's got loads of old
stuff. Mummies. Death masks.
Tombs --
HERMIONE
You know, the ancient Egyptians of
the Nile River delta worshipped
the cat goddess Bast.
Ron glares stonily at Hermione, then turns back to Harry.
RON
I also got a new wand.
Just then, a COMMOTION is HEARD. The Weasleys -- PERCY,
FRED, GEORGE, GINNY, ARTHUR, and MOLLY -- arrive en
masse, laden with purchases from Diagon Alley.
GEORGE
Not flashing that clipping about
again, are you, Ron?
RON
I haven't shown anyone!
FRED
No, not a soul. Unless you count
Tom. The day maid. The night
maid. The cook. The bloke that
came to fix the toilet. That
wizard from Belgium...
Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands, smiles. As
if relieved to see him.
MRS. WEASLEY
It's good to see you, Harry.
(CONTINUED)

23A CONTINUED: 23A
HARRY
Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. I wonder if I might have a
word.
HARRY
Of course, Mr. Weasley.
As Mr. Weasley pulls Harry away, the others continue to
hover over the clipping in the b.g.
FRED
George's nose looks positively
massive in that photograph.
GINNY
That's your nose, Fred.
FRED
Bloody hell. 'Tis, isn't it?
Take after your side of the
family, don't I, Mum?
Harry notices Mr. Weasley glance edgily at a FUGITIVE
POSTER tacked to the wall. In it, SIRIUS BLACK glowers
under the words, "Have You Seen This Man?"
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. There are some within the
Ministry who would strongly
discourage me from divulging what
I'm about to tell you. But I
think you need to know the facts.
Because you're in danger. Grave
danger.
Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.
HARRY
Has this anything to do with him,
sir?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
What do you know of Sirius Black,
Harry?
HARRY
That he escaped from Azkaban.
That he killed someone...

23A CONTINUED: (2) 23A
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry, thirteen years ago, when
you stopped...
Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue.
HARRY
Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
(nodding nervously)
Black lost everything. But he
remains a loyal servant to this
day. In his mind, only you stand
in the way of...
Once again, Mr. Weasley hesitates.
HARRY
Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry, I hate it when you say --
HARRY
I know, sorry. Ron hates it too.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
In Black's mind, only you stand in
the way of... You-Know-Who
returning to power. That's why
he's broken. That's why he's
broken out of Azkaban. To find
you. And...
Mr. Weasley hesitates yet again.
HARRY
Kill me?
Mr. Weasley nods. Nervously.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. I want you to swear
that -- whatever you might hear --
you won't go looking for Black.
HARRY
Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?
Mr. Weasley nods, then claps Harry on the shoulder.

26 EXT. PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS - MORNING 26
As the HOGWARTS EXPRESS BLEATS ITS HORN, we CRANE OVER
the milling horde of students. Parents hurry their
children onboard, tiny siblings wave goodbyes... and Mr.
Weasley dashes through the throng and up to an open train
window.
MRS. WEASLEY
Ron!
She hands Scabbers through the open window to him.
27 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - TRAIN CAR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 27
The aisle teems with students. Harry, Ron and Hermione
work their way down the aisle, looking for an empty
compartment.
HARRY
I didn't mean to blow her up. I
just...
(troubled by
the memory)
... lost control.
RON
Brilliant!
HERMIONE
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.
RON
I still think it was brilliant.
SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! A copy of the The Monster Book of
Monsters SCUTTLES CRAB-LIKE down the aisle, pursued by
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM.
NEVILLE
Hi, Harry. Ron. Hermione.

HARRY/HERMIONE/RON
Hi, Neville.
As he bumps past, Hermione nods to a compartment.
HERMIONE
C'mon. We're in here.
28 INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY 28
As they slip inside, they find a MAN in SHABBY ROBES
(PROFESSOR LUPIN) slumped against the window, asleep. He
looks ill, exhausted. The trio eye him warily. WHISPER.
RON
Who d'you reckon he is?
HERMIONE
Professor R.J. Lupin.
RON
You know everything. How is it
she knows everything?
HERMIONE
It's on his case.
She points. Stamped in peeling letters on a BATTERED
CASE is "Professor R.J. Lupin."
HARRY
Is he really asleep?
HERMIONE
Seems to be. Why? What is it,
Harry?
HARRY
Close the door.
Hermione and Ron exchange a curious glance, then Ron
rises, slides the door shut, OVER CAMERA, and we --
CUT TO:
29 EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - LATE DAY (LATER) 29
Storm clouds, like dark ghosts, toss SHEETS of RAIN onto
the scarlet engine as it heads north.

30 INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - LATE DAY 30
Ron and Hermione stare at Harry, faces stricken in the
lantern light that now glows in the compartment.
Crookshanks slumbers in his CAGE.
RON
Let me get this straight. Sirius
Black escaped from Azkaban to come
after you?
HARRY
Yes.
HERMIONE
But they'll catch Black, won't
they? I mean... eventually?
RON
Sure -- Of course, no one's ever
broken out of Azkaban before and
he's a raving, murderous
lunatic...
Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker.
The train LURCHES, begins to SLOW. Hermione slides down
the seat, pinning Ron against the window. They exchange
an awkward glance, then Hermione carefully slides to the
other end of the seat and glances at her WATCH. Frowns.
HERMIONE
Why're we stopping? We can't be
there yet...
Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the
corridor.
HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out
curiously. Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS --
and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...
31 EXT. TRAIN - SAME TIME - DUSK 31

32 INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - SAME TIME - DUSK 32

RON
What's going on?
(CONTINUED)
22.
32 CONTINUED: 32
A thin WISP of STEAM escapes Ron's mouth. Harry notices.
HARRY
Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?
HERMIONE
Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!
SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK. Ron, a dark silhouette against the
window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.
RON
There's something moving out
there. I think... people are
coming aboard.
Suddenly the CAR SWAYS violently... rights itself. The
METAL WINDOW TRIM at Ron's fingertips begins to VIBRATE.
RON
Bloody hell. What's happening?
SSSSST! A soft CRACKLING fills the car and FLAMES
bloom... in the hands of R.J. Lupin. In the SHIVERING
LIGHT, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are
alert. Wary.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Don't. Move.
A HAND -- slimy and scabbed -- a hand of death -- GRIPS
the half-open compartment door, pushes it aside.
REVEALS: a TOWERING, CLOAKED FIGURE, its face hidden
beneath its black hood. CROOKSHANKS' hair rises and as
she HISSES...
WHOOSHHHHH. The folds of the hood TREMBLE. A CHILL,
RATTLING INTAKE OF AIR is heard. The FLAMES in Lupin's
hands SPUTTER. A SOUND SWELLS in Harry's ears. Eerie.
Painful. The sound of a WOMAN SCREAMING. Harry's eyes
roll up, eyelids fluttering.
And then... a SILVERY WHITE LIGHT drifts from his mouth.
The world spins off its axis and Harry falls... glasses
tumbling hard to the ground... then Harry... the muscles
of his jaw twitching. THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTNING paints
the ICY windows...
WHITE.
BLACK.
WHITE.
(CONTINUED)
23.
32 CONTINUED: (2) 32
BLACK...
With a DESPERATE GASP, Harry opens his eyes. Blinks.
DUSK IS GONE. The windows BLACK. The floor at his spine
is SHAKING GENTLY. The train moving again. His eyes
shift, see a DROP OF WATER, newly unfrozen, running
slowly down the window.
HERMIONE
Harry? Harry, are you all right?
Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. He nods.
Sits up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand.
Harry's glasses.
HARRY
Thanks.
Harry slips them on. Discovers the cold sweat glazing
his brow. SNAP! Professor Lupin breaks a ragged
triangle of CHOCOLATE off the SLAB in his hands. Holds
it out.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Chocolate. Eat. It'll help.
HARRY
What was that -- that thing?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Dementor. One of the guards of
Azkaban. It's gone now.
Harry frowns in confusion.
HERMIONE
It was searching the train, Harry.
For Sirius Black.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I need to have a word with the
driver. Excuse me.
(the chocolate)
Eat. It'll help.
As he leaves, Harry turns to Ron and Hermione.
HARRY
What happened to me?
(CONTINUED)

32 CONTINUED: (3) 32
RON
Well, you sort of went... rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a
fit or something.
HARRY
And did either of you? You
know... pass out?
RON
No. I felt... weird. Like I'd
never be cheerful again. But...
no.
Harry turns to Hermione. She shakes her head.
HERMIONE
I was trembling. Cold. But
then... Professor Lupin made it go
away...
HARRY
But someone was screaming. A
woman.
Hermione and Ron glance nervously at each other.
HERMIONE
No one was screaming, Harry.
Harry looks to the window and we PUSH IN ON his
REFLECTION. It becomes a GLIMMERING PUDDLE and...

34 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT 34
SPLASH!... a CARRIAGE WHEEL shatters the glassy surface
as we TILT UP, catch a procession of HORSELESS CARRIAGES,
carrying students toward the glimmering castle.
Gradually, the sweet sound of a CHOIR rises on the air, a
FLASH of LIGHTNING bleaches the night sky and we --
CUT TO:
35 EXT./INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT (LATER) 35
... the CAMERA as it GLIDES TOWARD the windows of the
Great Hall, TOWARD the CANDLELIT SILHOUETTES glimmering
within, PASSING THROUGH the glass.
(CONTINUED)
25.
35 CONTINUED: 35
At the High Table, Lupin sits with SEVERUS SNAPE, MINERVA
McGONAGALL, RUBEUS HAGRID and ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. We TRACK
ALONG the FACES of the choir, singing to the strains of a
HARPSICHORD, and LAND ON a QUINTET OF TOADS (one of
which -- TREVOR -- belongs to NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, who
looks on with pride).
ARGUS FILCH, Hogwarts' caretaker, stands grimly to the
side as red-eyed MRS. NORRIS switches her tail at his
feet. As the choir's song concludes, DUMBLEDORE rises,
beaming over the sea of black hats.
DUMBLEDORE
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts! I have a few things
to say, before we become befuddled
by our excellent feast. I myself
am particularly looking forward to
the flaming kiwi cups, which,
while somewhat treacherous for
those of us with facial hair...
McGONAGALL clears her throat.
DUMBLEDORE
Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to
welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who
has kindly consented to fill the
post of Defense Against the Dark
Arts. Good luck to you,
Professor.
Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLAP
LOUDLY.
HERMIONE
Of course! That's why he knew to
give you the chocolate, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE
As some of you may know, Professor
Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
Creatures teacher for many years,
has decided to retire in order to
spend more time with his remaining
limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted
to announce that his place will be
filled by none other than our own
Rubeus Hagrid!
(CONTINUED)
26.
35 CONTINUED: (2) 35
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stare at each other --
stunned -- then APPLAUD vigorously. Hagrid turns ruby
red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sending
water goblets weaving.
DUMBLEDORE
(turning grave)
Finally, on a more disquieting
note, Hogwarts -- at the request
of the Ministry of Magic -- will,
until further notice, play host to
the Dementors of Azkaban.
A MURMUR of apprehension fills the hall. At the
Slytherin table, DRACO MALFOY, flanked by the ever
present CRABBE and GOYLE, catches Harry's eye, feigns
a dead faint.
DUMBLEDORE
The Dementors will be stationed at
the entrances to the grounds. While
they are under strict orders not to
enter the castle itself, you will on
occasion see them as you go about
your daily activities. Under no
circumstances are you to approach
them. It is not in the nature of
a Dementor to be forgiving.
36 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (LATER) 36
Students exit the Great Hall, scale the Marble Staircase.
37 INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE/SEVENTH FLOOR - NIGHT 37
Harry, Ron and Hermione arrive at the seventh floor

The Gryffindors trail through the common room, the girls

The Dementors drift to their positions outside the

As his breath CLOUDS THE GLASS, we gradually...
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
40 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - GROUNDS - MORNING 40
As BRIDGE and CASTLE glimmer in the distance, Hagrid
emerges from the Forbidden Forest, dragging a fistful of
dead FERRETS by the tail. A BIRD appears, circles his
head playfully, CHIRP-CHIRP-CHIRPING merrily before it...
... flutters off, pin-wheeling past flowers, into a
BIRDBATH, finally coming to rest upon...
... an ANCIENT TREE. It TWITTERS cheerfully, singing its
lovely song, when -- THWOCK! -- a branch punts the bird
into the air. As feathers fly, the WHOMPING WILLOW
resumes its shape.

Welcome, my children. In this

you possess...
A crimson scrim FLUTTERS and SYBIL TRELAWNEY, Divination
Professor, glides dramatically INTO VIEW, eyes huge and
bug-like behind enormous glasses.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
... the Sight. Hello. I am
Professor Trelawney. Together, we
shall cast ourselves into the
future. But know this. One
either has the Gift or not. It
cannot be divined from the pages
of a book. Books only cloud one's
Inner Eye.
HERMIONE (O.S.)
(under her breath)
What rubbish.
Ron spins. Frowns at Hermione.
RON
Where'd you come from?
HERMIONE
Me? I've been here all along.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
(spinning on Neville)
You, boy! Is your grandmother
well?
NEVILLE
I... I think so.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
(continuing)
The first term will be devoted to
the reading of tea leaves. If all
goes well, we will proceed to
palmistry, fire omens, and
finally... the crystal ball.

By the way, dear, beware a redhaired
man.

Parvati eyes Ron dubiously. Edges her pouffe away.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Unfortunately, classes will be
disrupted in February by a nasty
bout of flu. I myself will lose
my voice. And in late spring, one
of our number will... leave us
forever.
As the class exchanges uneasy glances, Trelawney smiles
brightly.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Well then. Shall we?
CUT TO:
TEACUP - DETAIL - LATER
Inside, a CLOUD of TEA LEAVES mutates oddly. Harry,
sitting opposite Ron now, frowns at the leaves, consults
the SYMBOLS in the textbook (Unfogging the Future) at his
elbow. Trelawney walks amongst them, robes flowing.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Broaden your minds, my dears. And
allow your eyes to see... beyond.
Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
A five-leaf clover... You can
expect to wake with a horrible
rash tomorrow morning, dear.
(then, casually)
Mr. Longbottom, after you've
broken your first cup...
CA-CHINK! Neville fumbles the cup in his hands and the
brittle CRASH of CHINA is heard.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
... would you be so kind as to
select one of the blue ones? I'm
rather partial to the pink.
(pausing by Ron)
What do you see in Mr. Potter's
cup, Mr. Weasley?
(CONTINUED)

42 CONTINUED: (3) 42
RON
Well. He's got a wonky sort of
cross -- that's trials and
suffering. But this lot here
could be the sun -- that's great
happiness. So... he's going to
suffer but be very happy about it.
Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and
GASPS.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Ahhh!
PARVATI
What is it, Professor?
Trelawney regards Harry with a mixture of pity and fear.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
My dear boy... You have the Grim.
SEAMUS
The Grin? What's the Grin?
PARVATI
The Grim.
Not the grin, you idiot.
DEAN THOMAS
But what does it mean, Professor?
LAVENDER
'The Grim...'
All turn, see Lavender bent over her textbook.
LAVENDER
'Taking the form of a giant
spectral dog, it is among the
darkest omens in our world. It is
an omen... of death.'
Harry peers into his cup. The tea leaves shift. The dog
disappears. And a new image emerges slowly...
Sirius Black.
43 EXT. CASTLE/BRIDGE/WHOMPING WILLOW/HAGRID’S HUT - DAY 43
The trio emerge from the BRIDGE and make their way toward
Hagrid's hut. The Whomping Willow looms in the distance.

HERMIONE
Death omens. Honestly. If you
ask me, Divination's a very wooly
discipline. Now Ancient Runes.
That's a fascinating subject.
RON
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking this term?
HERMIONE
A fair few.
RON
Hang on. Ancient Runes is the
same time as Divination. You'd
have to be in two classes at once.
HERMIONE
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?
(mimicking Trelawney)
Broaden your minds...
43A EXT. HAGRID’S HUT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 43A
STUDENTS gather around Hagrid as Harry, Ron and Hermione
arrive. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stand with the
Slytherins.
HAGRID
C'mon now, get a move on! Got a
real treat for yeh. Great lesson
comin' up. Follow me.
44 EXT. PADDOCK - HAGRID’S HUT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 44
Hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this side
of the Forbidden Forest. In the paddock, a freestanding
IRON RACK hangs with DEAD FERRETS, BUZZING with FLIES.
Nearby is a PUMPKIN PATCH.
HAGRID
Gather 'round. Find yerself a spot.
That's it. Now, firs' thing yeh'll
want ter do is open yer books --
DRACO
And exactly how do we do that?
(CONTINUED)
32.
44 CONTINUED: 44
Hagrid looks. Belts, rope, Spellotape: any means
available have been employed to bridle The Monster Book
of Monsters, which QUIVER VIOLENTLY.
HAGRID
Crikey. Didn' yeh know? All yeh've
got ter do is stroke 'em. Look --
Hagrid takes Hermione's copy, SNAPS the Spellotape
binding it. As it begins to BITE, Hagrid calmly runs a
forefinger down the book's spine and it... SHIVERS.
Falls quietly open.
Hagrid glances at the class, looking suddenly unsure.
HAGRID
Righ' then. So... so... yeh've
got yer books, an' now yeh need
the Magical Creatures. Right.
So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em.
Hagrid turns, disappears into the trees. Draco shakes
his head, SPEAKS LOUDLY to Crabbe and Goyle.
DRACO
God, this place is going to the
dogs. Wait until my father hears
Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching
classes.
HARRY
Listen, you stupid prat --
Eyes WIDENING in fear, Malfoy steps back, points.
DRACO
Potter, there's a Dementor behind
you.
Harry JUMPS, wheels in fear, finds... nothing. Instantly,
the SLYTHERINS make an eerie OOH... and OOH sound, then
break up laughing. Harry reddens, embarrassed, then...
A STRANGE BEAST (BUCKBEAK) emerges from the trees. It
has the torso, hind legs, and tail of a horse, but the
front legs, wings and head of a giant eagle. The
students step back in fear, then Hagrid appears, shooing
the beast on.
HAGRID
Gee up, there!
(grinning)
Beau'iful, isn' he?
(CONTINUED)
33.
44 CONTINUED: (2) 44
There seems no consensus on this, but the students stare
in wary wonder nonetheless. As Hagrid coaxes the beast
to the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily.
RON
Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
HAGRID
A Hippogriff, o' course. Now,
firs' thing yeh gotta know is
they're proud. Easily offended,
Hippogriffs are. Don't never
insult one, 'cause it migh' be
the las' thing yeh do. Right
then -- who wants ter come an'
say hello?
The entire class STEPS BACK, leaving Harry in front.
HAGRID
Good man, Harry!
Harry looks around, then -- reluctantly -- approaches.
HAGRID
Tha's it. Easy now... stop! This
here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want
ter let 'im make the firs' move.
It's polite, see? Jus' take step
forward, give 'im a bow, and if
Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed
ter touch him. Ready?
Unsure, Harry nods anyway. Steps forward. And... bows.
Buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily.
Harry waits. And waits...
HAGRID
Back off, Harry! Back off!
Harry starts to step back, when... Buckbeak ducks his
beak. Hagrid sighs, relieved.
HAGRID
Well done, Harry! Go on. Give
'im a pat.
Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand on
Buckbeak's fierce beak. The class CLAPS. Harry
smiles.
(CONTINUED)
34.
44 CONTINUED: (3) 44
HAGRID
Look at that! I reckon he migh'
let yeh ride 'im!
HARRY
(smile drooping)
Excuse me?
HAGRID
We'll jus' set yeh behind the
wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull
any feathers out. He won' like
that.
Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's
back, and before Harry's settled, SLAPS Buckbeak's
hindquarters.
HAGRID
Off yeh go!
As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back,
giant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! --
they SOAR into the air. Rising higher. And higher.
And higher.
Gradually, Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeak's neck.
Losing himself in the joy of flying. Smiling at the
sight of his and Buckbeak's SHADOW racing across the
grass below. Circling over the Whomping Willow, past
Hogwarts castle, and then SWOOPING, with heart-stopping
speed, over the Black Lake, Buckbeak's talons tickling
the smooth glass of the water, summoning the GIANT SQUID
to the surface briefly. Hagrid WHISTLES then, and
Buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock,
galloping to a halt. As Harry slides off, the class
CHEERS -- all except Draco, who narrows his eyes
maliciously.
HAGRID
Good work, Harry!
(under his breath)
How'm I doin' me firs' day?
HARRY
Brilliant... Professor.
They both grin, when Draco pushes past them roughly,
strides toward Buckbeak.
(CONTINUED)
35.
44 CONTINUED: (4) 44
DRACO
Give me a go at that thing. If
Potter can do it, it must be
easy. You're not dangerous at
all, are you, you great ugly
brute --
HAGRID
Malfoy! No!
In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfoy
freezes. Looks down at the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his
robes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward.
Buckbeak WHIPS AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing
Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry...
realizing what he's done... breathes.
DRACO
It's killed me! It's killed
me!
HAGRID
Calm yerself! Yer fine... jus'
a scratch...
Hagrid looks: a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp
arm.
HERMIONE
Hagrid. He's got to be taken to
a hospital. I'll go with you,
if you like --
HAGRID
No. I'm the teacher. You all...
you all just... Class dismissed!
And with that, Hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up
Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers
toward the castle.
45 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 45
As Lavender and Parvati huddle over a DOZEN TEACUPS,
Avidly interpreting patterns in HUSHED VOICES, Draco,
arm bound in a SLING, holds court before a clot of
Slytherins.
PANSY
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
(CONTINUED)

45 CONTINUED: 45
DRACO
(a tad theatrical)
It comes and goes. Still... I
consider myself lucky. According
to Madam Pomfrey, another minute
or two... and I could've lost the
arm.
Harry, Ron and Hermione watch from the Gryffindor table.
RON
The little git. He's really
laying it on thick, isn't he?
HARRY
At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.
HERMIONE
Yes. But I hear Draco's father's
furious. I don't think we've
heard the end of this...
SEAMUS
He's been sighted!
They turn. Seamus and the other Gryffindors are huddled
over a copy of The Daily Prophet.
RON
Who?
But the PHOTOGRAPH on the Prophet's front page provides a
chilling answer: Sirius Black. Hermione reads over the
shoulders of others. WHISPERS half to herself:
HERMIONE
Achintee? That's not far from
here...
NEVILLE
You don't think he'd come to
Hogwarts, do you?
LAVENDER
With the Dementors at every
entrance?
LAVENDAR
Dementors? He's already slipped
by them once, hasn't he? Who's
to say he can't do it again?

That's right. Black could be

catch smoke with your bare
hands.

49 INT. LUPIN’S CLASSROOM - MORNING 49
A tall WARDROBE RATTLES VIOLENTLY as Harry, Ron and
several classmates regard it warily.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Intriguing, yes? Would anyone
like to venture a guess as to
what's inside?
SEAMUS
(in a hushed voice)
That's a Boggart, that is.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can
anyone tell us what a Boggart
looks like?
HERMIONE
No one knows.
Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry.
RON
When'd she get here?
(CONTINUED)

49 CONTINUED: 49
HERMIONE
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever
a particular person fears most.
That's what makes it so --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Terrifying, yes. Luckily, a very
simple charm exists to repel a
Boggart. Let's practice it now,
shall we? Without wands,
please... Riddikulus!
STUDENTS
Riddikulus!
DRACO
(muttering softly)
It's this class that's ridiculous.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Good. So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone
is not enough. What really
finishes a Boggart off is...
laughter. You need to force it
to assume a shape you find truly
amusing. Neville, come up here,
will you?
Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe, steps forward
queasily.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
What would you say is the thing
that frightens you most?
NEVILLE
Profter... Snafpt...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry.
NEVILLE
Professor Snape.
Everyone LAUGHS good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Hmmm... yes. Neville, I believe
you live with your grandmother?
(CONTINUED)
39.
49 CONTINUED: (2) 49
NEVILLE
Yes, but I don't want the Boggart
to turn into her either.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
It won't. But I want you to
picture her clothes, only her
clothes, very clearly in your
mind. Can you do that?
NEVILLE
(closing his eyes)
She carries a red handbag...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's fine. We don't need to
hear it. If you see it, we will.
Now, when I open this wardrobe,
Neville, here's what I want you to
do...
Lupin leans close to Neville, WHISPERS. Neville's eyes
POP OPEN in shock. Consider Lupin uncertainly.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You can do this, Neville.
Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Right then. Wand at the ready.
One. Two. Three!
SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and
the wardrobe BURSTS OPEN. Instantly, Snape appears, eyes
flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs
away in fright.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Think, Neville. Think!
NEVILLE
R-r-riddikulus!
CRACK! Snape stumbles in a FLASH OF LIGHT and
reappears... in a LONG, LACE-TRIMMED DRESS, TOWERING
MOTH-EATEN HAT, and CRIMSON HANDBAG. Instantly, the
class ROARS (except for Draco and his fellow Slytherins).
Neville blinks, amazed, then slowly, grins himself.
Lupin drops the needle on an OLD GRAMAPHONE. As a
SCRATCHY RHUMBA fills the room, he points to Ron.
(CONTINUED)
40.
49 CONTINUED: (3) 49
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Ron! Forward!
Snape DISSOLVES into a mad whirling mass, then mutates
into a... GIANT SPIDER. As Ron GASPS, Harry and Hermione
exchange an uncertain glance. Lupin puts his hands on
Ron's shoulders to steady him. Ron raises his wand.
RON
Riddikulus!
CRACK! ROLLER SKATES materialize on the spider's hairy
feet and it begins to shuffle crazily in place.
Instantly, Ron relaxes as the class' LAUGHTER rings out.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Parvati!
As Parvati steps up, the spider SPINS faster and faster,
a DIZZYING BLUR, then reappears as a VAMPIRE.
PARVATI
Riddikulus!
As the vampire WHIPS its cloak across its eyes, we CUT
BEHIND... so our POV is of the students. SWISH! The
cloak reopens, the class LAUGHS, and we REVERSE again...
see that the vampire is now dressed like CARMEN MIRANDA.
As it begins to SHIMMY about -- against its will -- the
class starts to CLAP.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Mr. Thomas!
As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body
attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched
SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA.
DEAN THOMAS
Riddikulus!
The cobra's hooded head BOBS back and forth, transforms
into a JACK-IN-THE-BOX. Lupin grins and...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Next!
... turns, sees Harry step forward expectantly. Concern
flickers through Lupin's face. The Jack-In-The-Box
pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry,
becoming more sinister, transforming into a...
(CONTINUED)
41.
49 CONTINUED: (4) 49
... Dementor. Suddenly the MUSIC FADES. Harry starts to
raise his wand, then... freezes, transfixed. The
Dementor looms closer and closer, when...
... Lupin steps between, snaps his wand.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor vanishes and a ROILING MIST
appears, which becomes CLOUDS. Something glows within
the clouds, white, silvery and round...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
POP! The orb deflates like a punctured balloon, WHIZZES
crazily about the room, then darts back into the
wardrobe. The door SLAMS SHUT and the CLASS CHEERS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well done, everyone. I think
that's enough excitement for today.
As the students exit, chattering loudly, only Harry,
subdued, remains behind. At the doorway, Lupin glances
back, exchanges a private glance with him. As he exits,
the WARDROBE gives one last RATTLE.
50 EXT. CLOCK TOWER COURTYARD - MORNING (TWO WEEKS LATER) 50
A great buzzing queue of STUDENTS -- Third Years and
older -- each clutching a PERMISSION FORM -- pass by a
glowering Filch.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Remember! These visits to
Hogsmeade Village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect
poorly on the school in any way,
that privilege shall not be
extended again.
Harry approaches her, but before he can utter a syllable:
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
No permission form. No visiting
the Village. That's the rule,
Potter.
(CONTINUED)
42.
50 CONTINUED: 50
HARRY
Yes, Professor, but I thought if
you said I could go --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
But I don't say so. A parent or
guardian must sign, and since I am
neither, it would be
inappropriate.
(a flicker of pity)
I'm sorry, Potter. But that's my
final word.
Ron and Hermione -- watching Harry expectantly from
across the way -- see him turn, shake his head. Their
faces fall. Harry raises his hand in farewell. Watches
them go.
PROFESSOR LUPIN (O.S.)
So. No Hogsmeade, eh ?

Deep in the distance, some BOYS skate about on brooms,

FINDS Harry and Lupin walking along the bridge.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well, don't feel too bad. I was
roundly disappointed the first
time I went.
HARRY
Really?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
No. I was just trying to make you
feel better. Honeydukes' sweets
are the best in the world. Their
Pepper Imps are so strong you
smoke at the ears. And Zonko's
Joke Shop may be dangerous, but
you can't beat their Stink
Pellets.

55 CONTINUED: 55
HARRY
(nodding glumly)
Not to mention The Shrieking
Shack, which, according to
Hermione, is the most severely
haunted building in Britain.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Yes, that too...
HARRY
Professor, can I ask you
something?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You'd like to know why I stopped
you from facing the Boggart.
(off Harry's surprise)
I should think it'd be obvious. I
assumed the Boggart would take the
shape of Lord Voldemort.
Harry frowns. Lupin studies him curiously.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
But clearly... I was wrong.
HARRY
I did think of Voldemort first.
But then, I remembered that night
on the train... and the
Dementors...
(CONTINUED)
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well, well. I'm impressed. That
suggests that what you fear most
of all is... fear. Very wise.
HARRY
Before I fainted... I heard
something. A woman. Screaming.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors force us to relive the
worst memories of our lives. Our
pain becomes their power.
HARRY
I think it was my mother. The
night she was murdered.
Harry looks up. Finds Lupin studying him.
(CONTINUED)
44.
55 CONTINUED: (2) 55
PROFESSOR LUPIN
The first time I saw you, Harry, I
recognized you immediately. Not
by your scar. By your eyes.
They're your mother Lily's.
(nodding)
Yes. I knew her. She was there
for me at a time when no one else
was. We used to talk for hours.
She was not only a singularly
gifted witch but an uncommonly
kind woman. She had a way of
seeing the beauty in whoever she
met, even -- and perhaps most
especially -- when that person
couldn't see it in themselves...
Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Which perhaps explains her
affection for your father. James
had, shall we say, a certain
talent for trouble. A gift, rumor
has it, he passed on to you.
Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smiles
vaguely.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I could tell you stories -- and
there are many about your parents,
Harry -- but know this...
(eyeing Harry intensely)
They lived. Every moment of every
day. You should know that.
That's how they'd want to be
remembered.
56 INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING (LATER) 56
The Hall buzzes with tales of Hogsmeade, as students swap
stories, sample sweets, and send SOAP BUBBLES of all
shapes, sizes and colors into the air. A MARIONETTE of a
HARLEQUIN cavorts atop the Gryffindor table, moving its
limbs in response to the STRANDS of LIGHT that extend
from Neville's fingertips. Seamus passes his hand
through the light beams and -- FLUMPH! -- the Harlequin
collapses.

HERMIONE
And the post office! It's about
200 owls, all sitting on colorcoded
shelves, depending on how
fast you want your letter to go!
RON
And Honeyduke's is brilliant!
Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees --
and blood-flavored lollipops for
Halloween!
Harry nods, picking quietly through the spray of
brilliantly colored sweets on the table. Hermione
notices.
HERMIONE
But, I mean, after awhile, it got
a bit boring. Don't you think,
Ron?
RON
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing.
Hang on. I almost forgot. I got
you something wicked at Dervish
and Banges. It's a Pocket
Sneakoscope.
Ron places a SMALL GLASS SPINNING TOP on the table.
RON
If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's meant to light up
and spin. Mind you, Fred and
George say it's rubbish, sold for
wizard tourists, but I thought,
you know, it can't
hurt, given that...
HARRY
Sirius Black's trying to kill me.
Harry looks up, GRINS at the two of them.
HARRY
I'm glad you had a good time.
Really. And thanks for this.
(eyeing the Sneakoscope)
Rubbish or not, you're right. It
can't hurt.
With that, Harry pops a PEPPER IMP into his mouth.

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione climb the stairs, they find a
crowd gathering on the Seventh Floor landing.
RON
What's the hold-up? Only Neville
ever forgets the password.
PERCY
(pushing past)
Let me through, please. Excuse
me, thank you, I'm Head Boy...
(stopping dead)
Back! All of you! No one is to
enter this dormitory until it has
been fully searched!
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange dark glances, when...
Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen.
GINNY
The Fat Lady... she's gone.
RON
Probably stuffing her face with
the apples in that still life on
the second floor again.
GINNY
No. You don't understand --
Hermione GASPS. GRABS Harry's arm. He looks. SEES:
The Fat Lady's portrait has been SLASHED VICIOUSLY, great
strips of canvas hanging from the frame. Just then,
Dumbledore appears.
DUMBLEDORE
Mr. Filch. Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle for the Fat Lady.
(CONTINUED)

57 CONTINUED: 57
Just then, there is a SCREAM. The students dash to the
landing, where all THE PAINTINGS WHISPER FEARFULLY.
Filch's rheumy eyes peer up, searching the upper shadows,
then... narrow.
FILCH
There'll be no need for
ghosts, Professor...
Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near the
ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own,
trembling.
DUMBLEDORE
Dear lady. Who did this to you?
FAT LADY
(in a trance)
Eyes like the devil he's got. And
a soul as dark as his name. It
was him, Headmaster. The one they
talk about. He's here. Somewhere
in the castle. Sirius Black.
As the students REACT, Dumbledore's VOICE cuts through.

Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. The
rest of you... to the Great Hall.

A gentle CREAK is heard and Harry's eyes shift, see Snape
pass through the great doors, converge with Dumbledore.
SNAPE
I've done the dungeons,
Headmaster. No sign of Black.
Nor anywhere else in the castle.
DUMBLEDORE
(nodding)
I didn't really expect him to
linger.
SNAPE
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts castle on one's
own, completely undetected...
Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the
bait.
SNAPE
You may recall, prior to the start
of term, I did express my concerns
when you appointed Professor --
DUMBLEDORE
I do not believe a single
professor inside this castle
would have helped Sirius
Black enter it, Severus.
As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out over
the slumbering students.
DUMBLEDORE
No... I feel quite confident the
castle is safe. And I'm more than
willing to let the students return
to their Houses. But tomorrow.
For now, let them sleep...
As Dumbledore's gaze finds Harry, he shuts his eyes,
feigns sleep.
DUMBLEDORE
It's astonishing what the body can
endure when the mind allows itself
to rest.

63 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - MORNING 63
The Fat Lady has been replaced by a PAINTING of a TINY
KNIGHT (SIR CADOGAN). Stalking a bare stretch of grass
as his PONY grazes nearby, he brandishes his sword wildly
as a group of Gryffindors regard him warily.
SIR CADOGAN
Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan!
Back, you scurvy braggarts! You
rogues!
SEAMUS
He's barking mad!
DEAN THOMAS
What d'you expect? After what
happened to the Fat Lady, none of
the other pictures would take the
job.
NEVILLE
But he keeps changing the
password. Twice just this
morning! I've taken to keeping a
list.
As Neville holds up a wrinkled piece of parchment, Harry,
Ron and Hermione begin to exit.
SIR CADOGAN
Farewell, comrades! If ever you
have need of noble heart and
steely sinew, call upon Sir
Cadogan!
RON
Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever
need someone mental.

Turn to page 394.
As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy
finishes SCRAWLING something on a bit of PARCHMENT and
balls it up in his hands. As he opens them, a MOTH
flutters from his palms.
HARRY
Excuse me, sir, but... where's
Professor Lupin?
SNAPE
That's not really your concern, is
it, Potter? Suffice it to say,
your Professor finds himself
incapable of teaching at the
present time. Page 394.
Snape waves the MOTH away, blows out a candle and a SLIDE
SHOW BEGINS. An ANCIENT WOODCUT of a HORRIFIC BEAST
flickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at
his book.
RON
Werewolves?
HERMIONE
But, sir, we've only just begun
learning about Red Caps and
Hinkypunks. We're not meant to
start nocturnal beasts for
weeks --
SNAPE
Quiet!
RON
(to Harry)
When did she come in? Did you see
her come in...
SNAPE
Now. Which of you can tell me the
difference between an Animagus and
a werewolf?
As the class stares mutely at a SLIDE of an ATTACKING
WEREWOLF, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to
respond to Snape's question, the moth flutters by Harry.
(CONTINUED)

65 CONTINUED: (2) 65
SWAT! He pins it to his desk. A tiny cloud of moth dust
mushrooms into the air and Harry lifts his palm.
Malfoy's PARCHMENT has reappeared.
SNAPE
No one? How... disappointing.
HERMIONE
Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn
into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter.
Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
responds only to the call of its own kind --
Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.
SNAPE
Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must
admit to feeling your pain. That
is the second time you have spoken
out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell
me. Are you incapable of
restraining yourself? Or do you
take pride in being an
insufferable know-it-all?
RON
(to Harry)
He's got a point, you know.
Harry stares at the parchment. Malfoy has drawn a crude
caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING over and over.
SNAPE
Five points from Gryffindor!
(to the class)
As a antidote to your ignorance, I
prescribe two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf by Monday morning,
with particular emphasis placed on
recognizing it.
(suddenly)
Passing notes, Potter?
Snape SNATCHES the drawing from under Harry's nose. Eyes
it.
SNAPE
Not exactly Picasso, are you? I
hope you demonstrate more talent
on the Quidditch pitch this
weekend then you do as an artist.

As Snape turns away, Malfoy sniggers with Crabbe, Coyle

and we hear a true RUMBLE of THUNDER and --

free, soaring end over end into the sky, the...

in SCARLET, Hufflepuff in CANARY-YELLOW -- shoot into the
air. Twin BLUDGERS FIRE skyward, and the match is on.
We CUT INTO Harry, rising like a rocket through the mist,
his robes SNAPPING VIOLENTLY in the wind.
INTERCUT HARRY’S POV
-- as he flies, RAIN falling like NEEDLES before him,
every dark cloud concealing potential danger. Beaters
crisscross his path. A BLUDGER WHIZZES past, then a
second ROCKETS DIRECTLY AT HIM.
SWOOP! -- Harry ducks, watches the BLUDGER SHATTER the
BROOM of a HUFFLEPUFF BEATER. The Beater goes into a
wild spiral, vanishes in the mist.

Ron squints upward, the players little more than
STREAKING BLURS from his vantage. KA-SSSST! A STITCH OF
LIGHTNING strikes the TAIL of ANGELINA JOHNSON'S broom.
As it BURSTS into FLAMES, she PLUMMETS to the pitch. Ron
looks down at his own HAND. In the HIGHLY-CHARGED AIR,
the HAIR above his knuckles RISES.
In the sky, Harry flies fearlessly, searching for the
Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and
CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF VIEW far below. Suddenly, in
the stands opposite, a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand
of a RAVENCLAW GIRL. For a moment, it sails wondrously
through the heavy air, a Magritte dream, then -- WHOOP!
WHOOP! WHOOP! -- abruptly picks up speed, ROTATING LIKE
A HATCHET. Harry DUCKS, turns, and watches it disappear
into a bank of clouds. Then...
... something GLIMMERS: the Snitch. Instantly, Harry
jets off closing fast on the tiny, glimmering ball,
chasing it through one cloud... then another... and
another... until...
... he BREAKS into a clear patch of sky... only to find
the Snitch is gone. Angrily, Harry whips the Nimbus back
around, searching the horizon frantically, when he spies
something:
In the stadium's HIGHEST TOWER, something ENORMOUS
flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE, then is obscured by a
veil of mist.
Harry turns. In the distance, the stray umbrella spins
INTO VIEW, harpoons a player. Harry's eyes shift. The
SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of
a cloud. Harry begins to go... when the veil of mist
shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief
moment -- a GREAT DOG is revealed. As this mist closes,
Harry frowns, jets away.
As Harry pelts after the Snitch, the crowd RISES TO THEIR
FEET, ROARING. Ron GRINS over the binoculars, watching
Harry shred the mist as he urges his broom on.
HARRY
Faster!
Come on!
The trace of a smile forms on Harry's lips as he closes
on the Snitch... only yards away... reaching out...
when...

... a THIN GLAZE of ICE clouds his GLASSES. He wipes at
them, then flinches: BLOOD trickles down his cheek. The
rain is turning to needles. Needles of ice. Harry
glances at the HANDLE of his BROOMSTICK. The water
sluicing through the grain is FREEZING. VAPOR streams
from his mouth and nose.
SWOOSH! A dark SILHOUETTE passes on his right. He
turns. SWOOSH! -- a twin SILHOUETTE passes on his left.
Harry sees neither. Looks down. The layers of mist are
parting below. LIGHTNING STRIKES. Reveals: an ARMY OF
SILHOUETTES drifting onto the pitch. A vast legion of
them...
DEMENTORS.
A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND, rises in pitch,
not a whistle at all, but a... SCREAM. A WOMAN'S SCREAM.
Harry's eyes flutter, and wisps of SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
float from his mouth. His glasses glaze over completely.
His fingers, rigid, can no longer grip the broom and...
He FALLS.
HERMIONE
No!!!
Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions.
The Nimbus soars end over end, tossed by the currents,
then drops... right into the Whomping Willow.
FLOOMPH! Harry, in freefall, drops through one cloud,
then another. Plummeting through the circling Dementors.
Then... a TALL FIGURE rises from the crowd. Raises an
OPEN HAND to the heavens. Eyes angry but clear.
Dumbledore.
An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the
air.
A FLASH -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky.
And then...
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
Not a sound. For the longest time. Then... VOICES:

HARRY
Probably a right sight better than
he normally does.
Harry opens his eyes and Ron, Fred, George, and Hermione
SLOWLY COME INTO FOCUS, standing at the foot of his bed
in the hospital wing.
HERMIONE
Harry! How're you feeling?
69 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 69
As Harry edges up against his pillow, we see a NURSE in

Hufflepuff player's neck. Harry doesn't look so good
himself.
HARRY
Brilliant.
FRED
Gave us a right good scare, mate.
HARRY
What happened?
RON
You fell off your broom.
HARRY
Really? I meant the match. Who
won?
Silence. Uncomfortable glances.

it blew away? -- it sort of landed
in the Whomping Willow. And well...
He tips a BAG of SPLINTERED WOOD and TWISTED TWIGS onto
the bed. As Harry stares, we hear a gentle WIND, then...
PROFESSOR LUPIN (V.O.)
I'm sorry about your broom, Harry.
There's no chance of fixing it?
70 EXT. BLACK LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON 70
Harry shakes his head in response to Lupin's question,
then -- WHOOSH! -- sets Hedwig free of her traces. As
she soars into the sky, Harry and Lupin watch from the
lake's edge.
HARRY
Why do they affect me so,
Professor? I mean, more than
everyone else...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors are among the foulest
creatures that walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory, until a person
is left with nothing but his worst
experiences. You're not weak,
Harry. The Dementors affect you
most, because there are true
horrors in your past. Horrors
your classmates can scarcely
imagine. You have nothing to be
ashamed of.
HARRY
I'm scared, Professor.

I'd consider you a fool if you
weren't.

HARRY
But you made it go away.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
(a beat)
I don't pretend to be an expert,
Harry. But yes, I can teach you.
Perhaps after the holiday. For
now, though, I need to rest. I'm
feeling... tired.
Harry turns, studies Lupin's haggard face. A weary smile
appears as Hedwig's reflection glides over Lupin's
irises.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Beautiful...
Harry looks up, watches Hedwig pinwheel through the blue,
past the CLOCK TOWER and EXIT FRAME. CAMERA HOLDS, the
skies PALES, and SNOW begins to fall. We TILT DOWN...
70A EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY (WEEKS LATER) 70A
... to Hogwarts castle, weeks later, dusted in white.
71 EXT./INT. CLOCK TOWER - DAY 71
Harry, framed in the window, stares out, looking forlorn.
In REFLECTION, SNOW falls on the glass.
HARRY’S POV
A ragged line of students follows McGonagall toward the
bridge. Harry's POV becomes OBJECTIVE and...
72 EXT. C LOCK TOWER COURTYARD - DAY 72
... FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow, moving quickly to join
the other students.
(CONTINUED)
58.
72 CONTINUED: 72
Suddenly, Fred and George appear, heading the opposite
way and... the FOOTPRINTS reverse themselves... as if
Fred and George were escorting an invisible person.
FRED
Clever, Harry.
GEORGE
But not clever enough.
FRED
Besides, we've got a better way.
73 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 73
The great doors open and Fred and George enter. The
INVISIBILITY CLOAK drops and Harry is revealed, looking
cross. Instantly, Fred slaps a WORN ROLL OF PARCHMENT
into his hand. Harry unfurls it. Frowns. It's blank.
HARRY
What's this rubbish?
FRED
Rubbish he says. That there's the
secret to our success.
GEORGE
It's a wrench giving it to you,
believe me.
FRED
But we've decided your need's
greater than ours. George, if you
will...
GEORGE
I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.
George touches his wand to the parchment and INTRICATE
INK LINES surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like
veins. Harry reads the CURIOUS WORDS at the top:
HARRY
'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs are proud to present
The Marauder's Map'...?
GEORGE
Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and
Prongs. We owe them so much.
(CONTINUED)
59.
73 CONTINUED: 73
HARRY
Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And
that... No. Is that really...
Harry points to a small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore."
FRED
Dumbledore.
GEORGE
In his study.
FRED
Pacing.
GEORGE
Does that a lot.
HARRY
You mean, this map shows...
FRED
Everyone.
HARRY
Everyone?
GEORGE
Everyone.
FRED
Where they are.
GEORGE
What they're doing.
FRED
Every minute.
GEORGE
Of every day.
HARRY
Brilliant! Where'd you get it?
FRED
Nicked it from Filch's office, of
course, first year. Now listen.
There's seven secret passageways
out of the castle. But we'd
recommend...
(CONTINUED)

73 CONTINUED: (2) 73
FRED/GEORGE
This one.
GEORGE
The One-Eyed Witch on the third
floor.
HARRY
The One-Eyed...
FRED
Witch, right. But you best hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
(as they go)
Oh. And, Harry? When you're
done, make sure to give it a tap
and say, 'Mischief managed.'
Otherwise, anyone can read it.
74 INT. DIVINATION STAIRWELL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 74
Harry approaches a STATUE of a hump-backed, ONE-EYED
WITCH.
INSERT MAP -- Harry traces his finger along the tattered
surface to an INK FIGURE labeled "Harry Potter." A tiny
SPEECH BUBBLE appears: "Dissendium."
HARRY
Dissendium?
CLICK! The witch's EYE OPENS and the statue pivots,
revealing a DARK OPENING in the floor. As Harry
crouches, squinting, a cool DRAFT OF AIR ruffles his hair
and the CAMERA DRIFTS INTO the DARKNESS...
75 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - DAY (LATER) 75
A tiny LIGHT bobs in the distance, fracturing the
darkness, then Harry appears, the tip of his wand
GLOWING, map in hand. INSERT MAP: "Harry Potter" glides
across the parchment.
NEW ANGLE - DAY (LATER)
Harry stops, cranes his neck. STONE STEPS. Taps the map.
HARRY
Mischief managed.
61.
76 INT. HONEYDUKE’S SWEETSHOP - CELLAR - SAME TIME - DAY 76
CRATES. HUGE ROLLING BINS. A WOOD STAIRCASE. A
trapdoor lifts. Harry's eyes appear. As he pulls
himself up, a DOOR BANGS OPEN. Dense CHATTER ROARS from
above. Quickly, Harry hides, watches a MAN'S BOOTS
descend the stairs. Then...
WOMAN (O.S.)
A box of Jelly Slugs as well,
Horace. We're nearly cleared out.
HORACE grunts, begins moving boxes. Harry looks up to
the cellar door, takes out the invisibility cloak...
77 INT. HONEYDUKE’S SWEETSHOP - SAME TIME - DAY 77
The CELLAR DOOR EASES open -- but no one appears. We
TRACK THROUGH a sweet tooth's dream, SWARMING with
customers. Up ahead, Neville prepares to lick the
LOLLIPOP in his hand, when it simply floats from his
fingers and out the door...
78 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - CONTINUOUS 78
ACTION - DAY
... into the MISTY, FOG-SHROUDED chaos of Main Street.
As the lollipop drifts on, FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow
below...
79 EXT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DAY (LATER) 79
At this elevation, the MIST hangs in thick, undulating
veils, the Shrieking Shack an eerie silhouette in the
gloom. Ron and Hermione stand stiffly, attempting, as
best they can, to conceal the fact that, basically,
they're scared stiff.
HERMIONE
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I
mention that?
RON
Twice.
HERMIONE
Should we move a bit closer?
RON
Huh? Oh... All right...
(CONTINUED)
62.
79 CONTINUED: 79
They take a step. One step. Stop dead.
RON
Actually, it's fine from here.
HERMIONE
Perfect.
Just then, VOICES ECHO and THREE FIGURES appear over the
rise, phantoms in the mist. Malfoy. Crabbe. Goyle.
Pike.
DRACO
Well, well. Look who's here. You
two shopping for your dream home?
Seems a bit grand for you, WeaselBee.
Don't your family all sleep
in one room?
RON
Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
DRACO
(clucking his tongue)
Now that's not very friendly.
Boys, I think we're going to have
to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his
superiors.
HERMIONE
(a harsh chuckle)
Hope you don't mean yourself.
Malfoy's eyes shift, regard Hermione with disgust.
DRACO
How dare you speak to me, you
filthy, little mud --
SPLAT! Malfoy takes a SNOWBALL to the grill. Splutters:
DRACO
Who did that!
Malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- SPLAT!
SPLAT! -- he takes two more. Hermione and Ron glance
about uneasily.
DRACO
Well, don't just stand there!
(CONTINUED)
63.
79 CONTINUED: (2) 7 9
Crabbe and Goyle start for Ron and Hermione, when --
FLUMPH! -- their knees go out and they fall headfirst
into the snow. Draco begins to back away fearfully,
eying the mist...
DRACO
Wait a minute, there's something
out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!
Malfoy's SKI MASK is pulled over his eyes, he's spun
about, given a ROUGH KICK to the ass and sent stumbling
over the rise and out of sight. Instantly, Crabbe and
Goyle join him.
Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance,
and... DASH OFF... when -- FLUMPH! -- they both go
flying, land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up,
they hear...
LAUGHTER. Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion.
HERMIONE
Harry?
Harry...?
The Invisibility Cloak drops. Sure enough. Harry.
Grinning.
RON
That was not
Bloody hell, Harry!
funny!
But he's smiling. They all are. As he and Hermione pelt
Harry with SNOWBALLS, we --
CUT TO:
80 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - DAY (MOMENTS 80
LATER)
The trio trudge through the SWIRLING SNOW. Harry's
donned Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat to disguise
himself.
RON
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map!
HERMIONE
But Harry isn't going to keep it.
He's going to turn it over to
Professor McGonagall, aren't you?
(CONTINUED)
64.
80 CONTINUED: 80
RON
Oh sure. Along with his
invisibility cloak, his pack of
exploding snap cards, his --
HERMIONE
Oh, shut up.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
Rosmerta, m'dear!
Up ahead Cornelius Fudge emerges from a MINISTRY SLEIGH
as Hagrid swings the door clear and -- with unfortunate
ease -- rips it clean off the fittings. Fudge joins
McGonagall and a CURVY BARMAID (ROSMERTA) outside the
THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB.
HERMIONE
That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron
fancies her.
RON
It's not true!
HARRY
Shhh.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
I trust business is good?
MADAM ROSMERTA
It'd be a right sight better if
the Ministry wasn't sending
Dementors into my pub every other
night.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Sirius Black? In Hogsmeade! And
what would bring him here?
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Harry Potter.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Harry Potter!
(CONTINUED)
65.
80 CONTINUED: (2) 80
Fudge looks around nervously, then jerks his head toward
the pub. As he leads Rosmerta and McGonagall inside,
we --
CUT BACK TO:
HERMIONE AND RON
RON
Harry?
He's gone. FOOTPRINTS track through the snow, into the pub.
81 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - HARRY’S POV FROM UNDER THE 81
INVISIBILITY CLOAK - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
... as he THREADS THROUGH the teeming pub, PAST a SIGN
("No Underage Wizards") and nearly collides with some
very STRANGE-LOOKING PATRONS. Ron and Hermione ripple
briefly past a frosted window, then... THREE SHRUNKEN
HEADS swing INTO VIEW.
SHRUNKEN HEAD #1
So I says to him, 'Careful, Ned.
Don't want to go losing your head!'
As the three heads CACKLE HYSTERICALLY, bobbing up and
down on their strings, Harry turns... just as an UNSHAVEN
WIZARD'S arm whips down and a DART goes WHISTLING right
toward Harry's eyes. Harry DUCKS, pivots, and -- THWOCK!
-- sees the dart pierce the cork of the disfigured
DARTBOARD behind him.
Harry hurries on, trailing Fudge and McGonagall up a DARK
STAIRWELL as Rosmerta leads them into a small BACK ROOM.
As the door starts to close, Harry rushes forward: SLAM!
Too late. CAMERA TILTS. The KNOB turns, the door
opens...
82 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - CARD ROOM - DAY 82
... and SNOW flutters off the sill of a HALF-OPEN WINDOW.
McGonagall turns, frowning, and re-closes the door,
harder this time, then joins Fudge and Rosmerta. HARRY'S
POV SHIFTS FROM one TO the other as they speak.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Come on then. Let's hear it.
(CONTINUED)
66.
82 CONTINUED: 82
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Years ago, when Harry Potter's
parents were marked for death,
they went into hiding. Few knew
where they were. One who did was
black. And he told...
MADAM ROSMERTA
You-Know-Who. I've heard this
rot. It was all over The Daily
Prophet back in the day. And I'll
say now what I said then: Of all
the boys I ran out of here,
Black's the last who would've gone
over to the dark side. Hearsay.
That's all the Ministry had.
Hearsay.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!
MADAM ROSMERTA
Peter Pettigrew?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Little lump of a boy? Always
tagging after Black and...
MADAM ROSMERTA
I remember him. What's he got to
do with it?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
After the Potters were killed,
Pettigrew went looking for Black.
And, unfortunately... found him.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Black was vicious. He didn't kill
Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A
finger. That's all that was left.
A finger -- there's your hearsay.
Rosmerta looks to McGonagall. She nods grimly.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sirius Black may not have put his
hands to the Potters, but he's the
reason they're dead. And now he
wants to finish what he started.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Harry.
(CONTINUED)
67.
82 CONTINUED: (2) 82
McGonagall nods, then looks pained.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
But that's not the worst of it.
MADAM ROSMERTA
What could be worse?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
This: Sirius Black was and
remains today... Harry Potter's
godfather.
BLAM! The pub doors fly open, REVEAL Main Street, where
Ron and Hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the
chill. As they look down, CAMERA TILTS...
83 EXT. MAIN STRE ET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - MOMENTS LATER - 83
DAY
... and FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow. HARRY'S POV ENDS.
CAMERA TILTS UP, FOLLOWS Hermione and Ron until they
LEAVE FRAME, then HOLDS ON a POSTER of BLACK, fluttering
against a lamppost: "Have you seen this wizard?"
84 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 84
At the end of a ROCKY OUTCROP, the FOOTPRINTS end and
SOBS are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm, discouraging
her from going further, but she does, filling the
footprints with her own, then kneeling and -- very gently
-- drawing the cloak from Harry. He stares into the
mist, eyes stinging with tears.
HARRY
He was their friend. And he
betrayed them. He was their
friend.
(eyes hardening)
I hope he finds me. But when he
does, I'm going to be ready. When
he does, I'm going to kill him.
85 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (TRANSITION TO SPRING) 85
Butterflies flutter over the great green lawn. The GIANT
SQUID breaks through the last GLAZE of ICE on the Black
Lake. The Whomping Willow shakes the water from its
branches...
68.
86 INT. ASTRONOMY ROOM - DUSK 86
The DYING SUN streams through high windows, painting
Harry's face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposite
Lupin. ANCIENT CHARTS drape the walls while gleaming
SPHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently. Lupin
paces before a LARGE TRUNK.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic. Well
beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.
HARRY
If Black can fight the Dementors,
I need to know how too.
Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. The spell I'm going to
teach you is called the Patronus
Charm. Ever hear of it?
Harry shakes his head.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Patronus is a kind of positive
force. For the wizard who can
conjure one, the Patronus works
something like a shield. The
Dementor feeds on it instead of
him.
Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eyes
wander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attention
back.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
But in order for it to work, you
must think of a memory. And not
just any. This memory needs to be
a very happy one. And powerful.
Harry thinks a bit. Then... nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Got something? Good. Let it fill
you up. Lose yourself in it.
Then speak the incantation:
Expecto Patronum. Without your
wand...
HARRY
Expecto Patronum...
(CONTINUED)
69.
86 CONTINUED: 86
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Right then. Shall we?
Harry nods, raises his wand. Lupin, watching closely,
reaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Concentrate, Harry.
Concentrate...
As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES. In
the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly
horrific.
HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...
The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL BREEZE fills
the chamber. A SCREAM ECHOES distantly. Harry's hand
trembles. His eyes begin to roll up...
HARRY
Expecto... Expecto...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into the
packing case. Harry stands blinking. Dazed. Lupin
fishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket. Presses it into
Harry's trembling hand.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quickly.
Harry studies the frog. Takes a bite. Begins to
recover.
HARRY
That's one nasty Dementor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Boggart, Harry. The real thing
would be much, much worse. Just
out of interest, what were you
thinking of? What memory did you
choose?
(CONTINUED)
70.
86 CONTINUED: (2) 86
HARRY
The first time I rode a broom.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's not good enough, Harry.
Not nearly.
Harry glances toward the window, at the bloody sun.
HARRY
There's another. It's not happy
exactly. I mean, it is. It's the
happiest I've ever felt. But
it's... complicated.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Is it strong?
Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes. Emotional. Nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Then let's try it.
Harry takes a breath. Tosses the frog aside. Poises
himself.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Think, Harry, think --
HARRY
Just do it!
Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens the
packing case. Instantly, the Dementor appears again. A
chill fills the air. The hair skates off Harry's scar.
He sets his jaw...
HARRY
Expecto Patronum!
Harry's hand TREMBLES. His whole BODY TREMBLES. But he
holds his ground, when -- WHOOSH! -- a huge SILVER SHADOW
BURSTS from the end of his wand, hovering between him and
the Dementor. The Dementor falters... Harry's legs like
water...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
CRACK! The Dementor vanishes. Harry's arm drops.
Slack. Lupin eyes Harry with a kind of awe. His voice
barely a WHISPER.
(CONTINUED)
71.
86 CONTINUED: (3) 86
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well done.
HARRY
I think I've had enough. For
today.
Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
So you know, Harry: You'd have
given your father a run for his
money. And, believe me, that's
saying something.
Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself.
HARRY
I was thinking of him. And Mum.
Seeing their faces. They're just
talking to me. Just... talking.
That was the memory I chose. I
don't even know if it's real...
Harry grips the door, pushes past.
HARRY
But it's the best I have.
87 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT 87
All the boys asleep.
All except Harry, who lies in bed, studying the photo of
his parents, barely visible in the fluttering light of a
guttering candle. As the FLAME DIES with a soft HISS,
all goes BLACK and we --
CUT TO:
88 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT (LATER) 88
A hulking, haunted goliath against the sky.
89 EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT 89
A cautious breeze rises. Leaves scud across the gravel.
90 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 90
A church. Empty. Silent.
72.
91 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 91
A WINDOWPANE RATTLES, up high, the corridor thatched in
shadow. Slowly... CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE. CREEPING
FORWARD. A SHADOW ENGULFS Sir Cadogan, dozing against
his tree...
92 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 92
A WHISTLE SHRIEKS. The Sneakoscope, whirling madly,
skitters across the bedside cabinet and -- CLICK! CLICK!
CLICK! -- taps against a WATER GLASS, sending shafts of
RED LIGHT pinwheeling over the photo of Harry's
parents...
RON
Aaaahhhh!
Harry BOLTS UP, sees a SILHOUETTE etched on the window --
a MAN CLUTCHING A KNIFE. All the boys are up now.
Screaming. Amid the chaos, Harry grabs his wand.
HARRY
Everybody out!
The others flee. Harry faces the HULKING SHADOW, wand
poised.
HARRY
Show yourself.
Crash! The water GLASS SHATTERS on the floor and
Scabbers darts past Harry's bare feet, chased by
Crookshanks. Seizing the moment, the SILHOUETTE grasps
the curtains and swings through the open window, plunging
into the night. Harry rushes to the window, looks down.
92A EXT. GRYFFINDOR TOWER - CONTINUOUS ACTI ON - NIGHT 92A
The SILHOUETTE leaps from ledge to ledge with an animal's
grace, then... vanishes.
92B INT. TOWER DORMITORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 92B
Harry sweeps Ron's curtains aside. His bed is... empty.
HARRY
Ron!
Ron!
Harry's eyes flash toward the window, when... Ron pokes
his head out from under the bed.
RON
Is he gone?
73.
93 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 93
The entire Gryffindor House, in pajamas, stand before
McGonagall, who wears a TARTAN ROBE and an expression of
singular irritation.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
That's preposterous, Weasley. How
could Sirius Black possibly have
got through the portrait hole?
RON
I don't know how he got in! I was
a bit busy dodging his knife!
Just then, a curiously content Crookshanks wends his way
through Ron's legs.
RON
And this bloody cat ate my rat!
HERMIONE
That's a lie!
RON
It is not and you bloody well know it!
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Silence!
McGonagall turns then and everyone follows her eye to Sir
Cadogan who, sensing the attention, perks up instantly.
DUMBLEDORE
Sir Cadogan. Is it possible that
you let a mysterious man enter
Gryffindor Tower tonight?
SIR CADOGAN
Certainly, good lady! He had the
password. Had the whole week's,
in fact. On a little piece of
paper.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Which abysmally foolish person
wrote down the passwords and then
proceeded to lose them!
Every eye shifts once more: Neville. McGonagall sighs.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Is it always going to be you,
Longbottom?
(CONTINUED)
74.
93 CONTINUED: 93
NEVILLE
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
(to the group at large)
While we know Sirius Black is gone
tonight, I think you can safely
assume he will, at some future
time, attempt to return. Let me
be clear. You are not to move
about the castle alone. And you
are not to write down the
password! Understood!
A collective nod of the head. McGonagall gives the ties
of her robe a sharp tug, collects herself, and exits.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Very well then. Go to bed.
As the students drift off, Ron casts a last angry glance
toward Hermione, who now holds Crookshanks in her arms.
HARRY
I could've killed him.
Hermione turns, sees Harry staring out the window.
HARRY
He was right there. Close enough to touch.
I could've killed him.

96A EXT. SLOPE - DAY 96A
The trio make their way down the slope.
RON
I find it astonishing that someone
who prides herself on being so
logical can be in such denial.
HERMIONE
Harry. Will you explain to your
friend Ronald that he has
absolutely no proof whatsoever
that my sweet, unassuming cat ate
his shabby, decidedly decrepit
rat.
(CONTINUED)
75.
96A CONTINUED: 96A
RON
Harry was there! He'll tell you
how it was. Go on, Harry, tell
her.
HARRY
No, I won't. Know why? Because I
don't care about your stupid rat!
I don't care about your stupid
cat! I've got few other things on
my mind right now!
RON
Really? Wasn't you had to roll
under the bed last night to avoid
getting cut to ribbons! A person
could die being your friend,
Harry!
Ron stops, wishes he could take it back. They all wish
he could. Avoiding each other's eyes, they turn,
continue on.
97 EXT. BLACK LAKE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 97
Hagrid, wearing a GIGANTIC, HAIRY BROWN SUIT and perhaps
the world's ugliest YELLOW AND ORANGE TIE, stands knee
deep in the shallows of the Black Lake, skimming rocks as
big as flagstones across the water's shiny gloss. As he
turns, the trio catches a brief sight of his eyes, red
with tears, then he looks away.
HERMIONE
How'd it go, Hagrid?
HAGRID
Buckbeak liked London.
HERMIONE
I meant the hearing.
HAGRID
Oh. That. Well, I got up an'
said my bit -- You know, how
Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an'
as long as yeh treated 'im with
respect, he'd treat you the same.
Then Lucius Malfoy got up an' said
his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak
was a deadly dangerous beast that
no teacher in their righ' mind
would expose their students to...

97 CONTINUED: 97
HERMIONE
(dreading it)
And...?
Hagrid slings another rock into water.
HERMIONE
You mustn't blame yourself,
Hagrid.
RON
Draco. It's him the Committee
should punish. It's him they
should send off to the forest, not
Buckbeak.
HAGRID
Buckbeak's not going back to the
forest...
HERMIONE
(dreading the answer)
Where's he going, Hagrid?
HAGRID
He asked fer the worse, yeh see,
Lucius Malfoy did. An' the
Committee granted it. Buckbeak's
bin sentenced ter death.
98 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT 98
Dark. Ominous. Dementors drift in the distance.
Restless...
99 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT 99
Silent. A room of shadows. While those around him
slumber, Harry lies awake, unable to sleep. Finally, he
turns to his cupboard, takes the Marauder's Map.
WHISPERS:
HARRY
I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.
The crooked corridors and serpentine passageways of
Hogwarts radiate across the parchment, then... a TINY DOT
catches Harry's eye. He frowns. It reads: "Peter
Pettigrew."
77.
100 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 100
Harry moves down a DARK corridor, map in hand, WAND
AGLOW. In the PAINTINGS he passes, the subjects SNORE
SOFTLY.
INSERT - MARAUDER’S MAP
"Harry Potter" and "Peter Pettigrew" draw closer and
closer.
BACK TO SCENE
Harry squints toward the end of the corridor. Down at
the map. Pettigrew moves quickly down the adjoining
corridor. Twenty yards away. Ten. Only seconds away...
Wand trembling in his hand, Harry glances from the map to
the dark corridor ahead, again and again. Then... as the
two DOTS are about to collide... he looks slowly up...
turns the corner... heart in his chest... and meets...
HIMSELF
... reflected in a MIRROR. He BLINKS, startled, then
glances back down at the map. Pettigrew has moved past
him. Confused, Harry wheels, casts his wand along the
walls.
VOICE (O.S.)
Watch it there, boy!
Harry JUMPS. But it's only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING,
scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. On the map,
"Pettigrew" continues to move away. Harry makes to
follow, then stops. HEARS FOOTSTEPS. The WAND'S SPOT
dances across the parchment, finds another DOT.
Approaching FAST: "Severus Snape."
HARRY
Mischief managed!
Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and
turns... into the harsh glare of Snape's wand.
SNAPE
Potter. What're you doing
wandering the corridors at night?
HARRY
I was... I was... sleepwalking...
A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips.
(CONTINUED)
78.
100 CONTINUED: 100
SNAPE
How extraordinarily like your
father you are, Potter. He, too,
was exceedingly arrogant.
Strutting about the castle --
HARRY
My dad didn't strut. Nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
appreciate you lowering your wand.
Snape eyes Harry coldly. Containing himself. Lowers his
wand.
SNAPE
Turn out your pockets.
Harry doesn't move, eyes still boring into Snape.
SNAPE
Turn out your pockets!
Finally, Harry obliges. Seeing the map, Snape's eyes
glitter.
SNAPE
And this. What might it be?
HARRY
Spare bit of parchment...
SNAPE
Really...
(poising his wand)
Reveal your secret!
To Harry's horror, words begin to appear. Snape studies
him, a sadistic half-smile on his lips. Turns the map
his way.
SNAPE
Read it.
HARRY
'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and...'
SNAPE
Go on.
(CONTINUED)
79.
100 CONTINUED: (2) 100
HARRY
'... and request that he keep his
abnormally large nose out of other
people's business.'
SNAPE
(smile drooping)
Why you insolent little --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Professor...?
Snape turns. Sees Lupin standing in the shadows.
SNAPE
Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little
walk in the moonlight, are we?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry? You all right?
SNAPE
That remains to be seen. I've
just now confiscated a rather
curious artifact from Mr. Potter.
Take a look, Lupin. This is
supposed to be your area of
expertise.
Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather
unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions.
SNAPE
Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I seriously doubt that, Severus.
It looks to me as if it merely
insults anyone who tries to read
it. I suspect it's a Zonko
product. Nevertheless, I shall
pursue any hidden qualities it may
possess. As you say, it's my area
of expertise. Come, Harry.
101 INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN’S OFFICE - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) 101
Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map
fiercely.
(CONTINUED)
80.
101 CONTINUED: 101
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I don't know how this map came to
be in your possession, Harry, but
I'm astounded that you didn't turn
it in. Did you ever stop to think
that this -- in the hands of
Sirius Black -- is a map to you?
Harry walks silently. Lupin can barely contain his anger.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father didn't set much store
by rules either. But he and your
mother did give their lives to
save yours. Gambling their
sacrifice by walking about the
castle unprotected, with a killer
on the loose, strikes me as a poor
way to repay them. I won't cover
up for you again, Harry.
Lupin enters his office, tosses the map on his desk, and
begins to sort through some papers. Harry lingers
briefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOON
that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn
away. Stops.
HARRY
Professor. Just so you know, I
don't think the map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the
castle. Someone I know to be dead.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
(only half-listening)
And who was that, Harry?
HARRY
Peter Pettigrew.
Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his
papers.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. I'd like you to return
to your dormitory now. Oh, and
Harry? Don't take any detours.
As Harry looks back, Lupin taps the map.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
If you do. I'll know.
CUT TO:

CLOSEUP - CRYSTAL BALL
murky with smoke.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY (V.O.)
Relax... Let your mind... go...
102 INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING 102
The students gaze into CRYSTAL BALLS, faces reflecting
the mist within, so that their very skin seems to be made
of smoke.
Conspicuously, Harry, Ron and Hermione sit apart.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Crystal-gazing requires that you
clear the Inner Eye. Only then,
will you... See. Oh my, what do
we have here...?
As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her
eyes.
HERMIONE
Here we go again. It's the Grim!
It's the Grim!
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
(eyes narrowing)
My dear, from the moment you first
arrived in my class, I sensed that
you did not possess the proper
spirit for the noble art of
Divination. You may be young in
years, but the heart that beats
beneath your bosom is as shriveled
as an old maid's, your soul as dry
as the pages of the books to which
you so desperately cleave.
Stung, Hermione starts to reply, but -- remarkably --
seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly,
she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry
watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the
doorway...
LAVENDER
'In late spring, one of our number
will leave us forever!' You knew,
Professor! You saw.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
On these occasions, I take no joy
in my gift, Miss Brown.
82.
102A EXT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING (LATER) 102A
As the students exit, Ron, walking separately from Harry,
turns to Neville.
RON
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean, not that she wasn't always
mental, but now it's out in the
open for everyone to see...
Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry
watches him go, along with the others, then spies
Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing.
102B INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 102B
Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts
to go, when... the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly
DARKENS. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that
appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then,
a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and...
... a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder. He wheels,
finds...
HARRY
Professor Trelawney --
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
He will return tonight....
Harry stiffens. Trelawney's voice is eerily HOLLOW.
HARRY
S-sorry?
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Tonight, when the clock strikes
twelve, the servant shall break
free. He and his Master shall be
reunited. It cannot be prevented.
Trelawney smiles savagely... then her head falls forward.
When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon
Harry's shoulder. Her hand.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
So sorry, dear boy. Did you say
something?
Her voice is normal once more. Harry shakes his head.
HARRY
No. Nothing.
83.
103 INT. DIVINATION STAIRWELL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 103
Harry -- clearly unsettled by his encounter with
Trelawney -- hastens down the stairs, and we...
FADE OUT.
104 INT. C LOCKTOWER COURTYARD - DAY (LATER) 104
SWOOK! SWOOK! We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as
it glides to the flock circling the feet of a POT-BELLIED
MAN (THE EXECUTIONER) sitting in the courtyard. As he
sharpens his AXE -- SWOOK! SWOOK! -- we --
CUT TO:
HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE
hurrying past. The Executioner looks up and we --
CUT TO:
105 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 105
... Harry, leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut.
HERMIONE
I can't believe they're going to
kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.
HARRY
It just got worse.
She and Ron look and SEE:
106 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - LATE 106
AFTERNOON
Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a
grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand,
spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch,
tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Hagrid wipes his eyes,
lopes into the hut.
DRACO
Did you see the big, fat
blubbering oaf?! Oh, this is
going to be rich. Did I tell you,
Father said I can keep the head --
(looking up)
Ah. Come to see the show?
(CONTINUED)
84.
106 CONTINUED: 106
HERMIONE
You... foul... loathsome...
evil... little cockroach...
Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear
as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose,
when...
RON
Hermione! No!
She turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. He looks away.
RON
He's not worth it.
Hermione nods, then -- SMACK! -- quick as lightning,
lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat
on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs,
Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind.
HERMIONE
That felt good.
107 EXT. SLOPE/PUMPKIN PATCH - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 107
LATER)
The trio makes their way down the slope and past
Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction.
108 INT. HAGRID’S HUT - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK) 108
Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and
Ron sit. Hermione makes tea.
HAGRID
Look at 'em. Loves the smell
o' the trees when the wind
blows...
HARRY
I say we set him free.
HAGRID
(shaking his head)
They'd know I did it. And tha'
would only get Dumbledore in
trouble. Gonna come down, yeh
know. Says he wants ter be with
me when it... when it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
(CONTINUED)
85.
108 CONTINUED: 108
HERMIONE
We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
HAGRID
Yeh will not! Think I wan' yeh
seein' a thing like this! No.
Yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off.
But before yeh do -- I wan' ter
see you an' Ron shake hands,
Harry.
Ron and Harry exchange a glance, then look to Hagrid.
HAGRID
Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin
betw'n you two? Go on now...
Reluctantly, Harry and Ron extend their hands. Shake.
HAGRID
Good. Now then. Ron, I wan' ter
see you give Hermione a hug.
HERMIONE/RON
What!
HAGRID
Go on! You two've been at it all
year. An' I'm sick o' it.
Acutely uncomfortable, Hermione and Ron step forward and
perform perhaps the most awkward hug Hogwarts has ever
seen.
HAGRID
Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most
pathetic hug I e'er seen. But yeh
did it, an' tha's wha' matters.
There's jus' one other thing...
RON
I'm not kissing Fang if that's
what you're thinking...
Hearing his name, FANG -- Hagrid's giant boarhound --
THUMPS his tail happily on the floor. Hagrid turns,
takes the lid from a FLOUR TIN, A TINY HEAD, ears flecked
with powder, emerges.
RON
Scabbers! You're alive!
(CONTINUED)
86.
108 CONTINUED: (2) 108
HAGRID
Yeh should keep a closer eye on
yer pets, Ron.
HERMIONE
I think you owe someone an
apology.
RON
Right. Next time I see
Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
HERMIONE
I meant me.
HAGRID
Crikey. Here we go agin...
SMASH! A GLASS JAR on the SHELF SHATTERS. As Hermione
scoops up a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE, a second STONE
bounces off the back of Harry's head.
HARRY
Ow!
Harry turns, looks out the window.
HARRY
Hagrid...
Everyone turns. Looks. Dumbledore and Fudge approach.
Behind them, in a fluttering shroud of CROWS, the
Executioner follows, axe at his side. Hagrid begins to
panic.
HAGRID
Yeh got to go! It's almost dark.
Anyone sees yeh outside the castle
it'll be trouble! Big trouble!
'Specially you, Harry --
BANG! BANG! BANG! The door SHAKES. Hagrid stiffens in
fear. Harry reaches up, puts his finger to Hagrid's
trembling lips, speaks softly to the others.
HARRY
C'mon.
109 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT - PUMPKIN PATCH - WIDE SHOT - DUSK 109
(MOMENTS LATER)
As the trio exit through the back door, Fudge, Dumbledore
and the Executioner enter through the front.
(CONTINUED)
87.
109 CONTINUED: 109
A veil of crows flutters onto the roof. More drop into
the patch, begin to slowly circle Buckbeak.
Harry and the others duck behind the pumpkins, watch
Hagrid solemnly greet the others. Fudge appears at the
window. Picks his nose. Just then, a Shhh! is heard.
Hermione turns. The branches of the trees behind her are
DANCING ODDLY.
HARRY
What?
HERMIONE
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.
110 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 110
The trio slip silently into a stand of trees. Beyond
them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun.
High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.
DING!
DING!
DING!
The trio stops, fighting their tears. A QUARTET OF BLEAK
SHADOWS files from the hut. One of the SHADOWS --
Dumbledore -- raises his hand and points, directing the
attention of the others away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore
speaks briefly -- unintelligible from this distance,
then -- CAW! CAW! -- The crows SHRIEK excitedly and the
Executioner separates from the others, disappears behind
a LOW STAND OF TREES.
DING!
All goes very still. The wind loses its voice...
DING!
Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees,
INTO VIEW...
DING!
The ax hangs seemingly forever, etched against the sky,
then drops from sight. A SICKENING CHOP! fouls the
breeze and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb
disbelief. Hermione, face turned away, trembles...
(CONTINUED)
88.
110 CONTINUED: 110
DING!
The SUN sets, dropping behind the mountains in the
distance. Hermione turns. Sees a frenzied spray of
crows stain the bloody sky, their PRIMAL SHRIEKING rising
like a curse.
Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder and
CAMERA FALLS WITH her, CONTINUING DOWN the length of
Ron's arm to his hand, where a DROP OF BLOOD hangs from
his finger, drops like a tear...
DING!
Ron stares at his hand. At the blood running down his
finger.
RON
He bit me...
His eyes shift. See Scabbers streaking away.
HERMIONE
Ron! No!
As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give
chase.
110A EXT. RIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110A
Ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top.
Hermione and Harry follow.
110B EXT. WHOMPING WILLOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110B
Harry and Hermione reach the top of the ridge. Stop.
HERMIONE
Harry. You do realize what tree
this is...
Ron nabs Scabbers, cradles him in his bloody palm.
RON
Now behave yourself.
CAMERA PULLS BACK: Ron is kneeling under the Whomping
Willow.
(CONTINUED)
89.
110B CONTINUED: 110B
HARRY
That's not good.
(yelling)
Ron! Run!
Ron spins. Looks toward Harry.
RON
Harry! Run!
Harry's eyes shift. Bounding toward him in the gathering
gloom is an ENORMOUS, PALE-EYED, JET-BLACK... DOG. Harry
shields himself when... the dog LEAPS CLEAR OVER HIM.
RON
Aaaahhh!
The dog's TEETH flash and -- SNAP! -- close on Ron's
foot, dragging him TOWARDS THE TRUNK like a rag doll.
Instantly, Harry dashes forward, leaps out, and grabs
Ron's hands... but he and Ron just keep skudding along
the ground.
HERMIONE
I've got you --
Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the
three of them go scudding along.
RON
Harry!
Harry raises his chin. The dog vanishes into the GAP at
the base of the tree, begins to pull Ron through...
HARRY
Hold on, Ron!
But it's no use. The dog is too powerful. Harry glances
around desperately, then finds himself looking directly
in Ron's eyes. He can read his mind.
HARRY
No, Ron...
One by one, Ron releases his fingers from Harry's
forearm. Sacrificing himself.
HARRY
Nooooo!!!
But Ron closes his eyes, releases his hands fully, and...
(CONTINUED)
90.
110B CONTINUED: (2) 110B
Disappears. As his VOICE ECHOES deep into the earth...
Harry and Hermione rise, peer into the hole.
WHOMP! The Whomping Willow sweeps first Hermione, then
Harry, into the air and -- FLOOMPH -- drops them on their
backsides.
HARRY AND HERMIONE’S POV - THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD
Swaying beautifully against the dusky sky, swishing
softly.
BACK TO SCENE
As one, they rise. Run back toward the gap in the tree.
A branch swoops down.
Hermione ducks. Harry doesn't. WHOOSH -- he is flung
one way, his GLASSES the other.
Hermione HOPS over another branch -- looks briefly
pleased with herself -- only to find herself SWEPT HIGH
IN THE AIR by a second branch. She looks down, sees
Harry searching the ground for his glasses.
HERMIONE
Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
Harry squints up, sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST of a branch
screaming straight down for his head. He rolls away just
as -- WHOMP! -- the branch PULVERIZES the ground.
Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME, still clinging on for dear
life, and Harry rises. FLUMPH! -- he's promptly knocked
to the ground again. Hermione goes CRASHING through the
high branches, Harry spies his glasses and grabs them.
Rising, he fits them to his face and...
HIS BLURRY POV...
... turns CRYSTAL CLEAR just in time to see Hermione
FLYING MADLY TOWARD HIM.
HERMIONE
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
HARRY
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Hermione reaches out, grabs Harry's shirt and -- riding
the branch in tandem -- the two boomerang back, hurtling
toward the trunk of the tree, through the gap, and into
the darkness...
91.
111 INT. WILLOW ROOTS - TUNNEL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 111
... below. OOMPH! Harry hits the ground hard. OOMPH!
Hermione falls on top of him.
HERMIONE
Thanks.
HARRY
Don't mention it. Lumos.
As the tip of Harry's WAND GLOWS, reveals a long, snaking
tunnel.
HERMIONE
Where do you suppose this goes?
HARRY
I have a hunch. I just hope I'm
wrong...
111A INT. TUNNEL TO SHRIEKING SHACK - NIGHT 111A
Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive
passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead.
Then, abruptly, the tunnel... ends. Confused, Harry and
Hermione glance about, then -- as one -- peer up. A
small opening. Harry reaches up, hoists himself through.
112 INT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DECREPIT ROOM - NIGHT 112
Harry pulls Hermione up. Looks about. Paper peels from
the walls. Stains -- suspiciously similar to dried blood
-- blot the floorboards. Shattered furniture lies strewn
everywhere.
HERMIONE
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?
Harry doesn't answer, staring at the DOG PRINTS in the DUST
on the floor. The CEILING CREAKS. They dash to the stairs.
113 INT. HALLWAY - LANDING - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 113
They come out, look down. A wide, shiny stripe cuts
through the DUST-LADEN floor -- as if something has been
dragged -- to the end of the hallway, where a LIGHT seeps
from a door.
HARRY
Nox.
(CONTINUED)
92.
113 CONTINUED: 113
His wand-light dies. Slowly, they step to the door.
Exchange a look. She nods, wand ready, and Harry KICKS
the door aside.
114 INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME 114
Ron sits upon a sagging bed, clutching his bloody foot.
HERMIONE
Ron! You're okay --
HARRY
The dog -- where's the --
RON
He's the dog.
It's a trap, Harry.
He's an Animagus...
Harry looks down, follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to
a pair of FILTHY HUMAN FEET. Harry looks up slowly at
the MAN standing in the shadows. Filthy, matted hair
hangs to his shoulders. His skin like a corpse.
SIRIUS BLACK.
He studies Harry's face keenly. Harry draws his wand.
HERMIONE
If you want to kill Harry, you'll
-- you'll... have to kill us, too!
SIRIUS BLACK
No. Only one will die tonight.
HARRY
Then it'll be you!
HERMIONE
Harry! No!
Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound. Black wheels toward the
door, edgy. Harry eyes Black, wand hand shaking
violently. As Black turns back, he stops, regards Harry
cautiously.
SIRIUS BLACK
Going to kill me, Harry?
HARRY
Yes.
(CONTINUED)
93.
114 CONTINUED: 114
Harry raises his wand. BLAM! -- the DOOR CRASHES OPEN:
Lupin.
HARRY/HERMIONE/RON
Professor Lupin!
Lupin ignores them, eying Black intensely.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Looking a bit ragged, aren't we,
Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
the madness within.
SIRIUS BLACK
You'd know all about the madness
within, wouldn't you, Remus?
The two regard each other, the moment taut with tension,
then Lupin steps forward and... EMBRACES Black like a
brother.
HERMIONE
No! I trusted you! I covered up
for you. And all this time you've
been his friend!
(pointing)
He's a werewolf! That's why he's
been missing classes!
Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin. Black HOWLS
then, bitterly amused. Lupin eyes him, then turns back.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
How long have you known?
HERMIONE
Since Professor Snape set the
essay.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're the brightest witch of your
age I've ever met, Hermione.
SIRIUS BLACK
Yes, you glow like the sun. And
you howl at the moon. Enough
talk! He dies. Now. If you
won't do it with me, Remus, I'll
do it alone.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Wait, Sirius --
(CONTINUED)
94.
114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
I did my waiting! Twelve years of
it! In Azkaban! Trust me, you
wouldn't have lasted a week!
Lupin eyes Black, then nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
All right then. As you wish...
HARRY
No!
Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and, with a flick
of his own, disarms him. Furious, Harry eyes Black
murderously.
HARRY
You betrayed my parents! You sold
them to Voldemort!
SIRIUS BLACK
It's a lie! I never would've
betrayed James and Lily!
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry! You've got to listen --
HARRY
Did he listen! When my mother was
dying! Did he hear her screaming!
SIRIUS BLACK
No! I wasn't there! And I'll
regret it the rest of my life!
Harry's eyes flash to Black's, glittering with pain.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Someone else betrayed your
parents, Harry. Someone in this
room right now. Someone who,
until quite recently, I believed
to be dead.
SIRIUS BLACK
He's as good as dead.
HARRY
What're you talking about?
There's nobody here.
(CONTINUED)
95.
114 CONTINUED: (3) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
Oh yes there is...
Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a cruel sing
song:
SIRIUS BLACK
Come out, come out, Peter
Come out, come out and play...
Ron draws back from Black's demented gaze.
RON
You're mad...
Harry's eyes shift from Ron's FACE to his HANDS, where
Scabbers TWISTS violently. As a curious expression
befalls Harry, Lupin and Black, as one, raise their
wands... when.
SNAPE
Expelliarmus!
The wands fly from their hands. The others turn, find
Snape standing in the doorway, smiling smugly.
SNAPE
(eying Black)
Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I
hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Severus --
SNAPE
I told Dumbledore you were helping
your old friend into the castle.
And here's the proof.
SIRIUS BLACK
Brilliant! And -- as usual --
dead wrong. Now give us our wands
back. Remus and I have a bit of
unfinished business to tend to.
As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck.
SNAPE
Give me a reason. I beg you.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Don't be a fool, Severus!
(CONTINUED)
96.
114 CONTINUED: (4) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
He can't help it. It's habit by
now.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quiet, Sirius!
SNAPE
(clucking his tongue)
Listen to you two. Quarreling
like an old married couple. The
creature and the criminal.
SIRIUS BLACK
Piss off.
SNAPE
Witty as ever I see. Tell me,
will you be so irreverent when I
turn you over to the Dementors?
(as Black reacts)
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
One can only imagine what it must
be like to endure the Dementor's
Kiss. It's said to be unbearable
to witness. But I'll do my best.
Snape's eyes harden. He gestures to the door.
SNAPE
After you.
As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table
where Lupin has left Harry's wand. In a flash, it's in
his hand.
HARRY
Expelliarmus!
Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a THUD, and
slides down. Ron and Hermione stare in shock.
HERMIONE
You attacked a teacher.
Harry.
Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.
HARRY
You said Peter before. Peter who?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Pettigrew. He was at school with
us. We thought he was a friend.
(CONTINUED)
97.
114 CONTINUED: (5) 114
HARRY
He killed
No. Pettigrew's dead.
him.
As Harry points at Black, Black laughs mirthlessly.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I thought so, too. Until you
mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the
Map.
HARRY
The Map was lying then --
SIRIUS BLACK
The Map never lies. Pettigrew's
alive. And he's right there.
Black points at... Ron. Ron goes white with fear.
RON
M-me? It's lunatic...
SIRIUS BLACK
Not you, you idiot. Your rat.
RON
Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my
family for --
SIRIUS BLACK
(bitterly)
Twelve years. A curiously long
life for a common garden rat.
He's missing a toe, isn't he?
Black unfolds a dog-eared clipping from The Daily
Prophet: it shows Ron in Egypt with his family, Scabbers
on his shoulder.
RON
So what?
HARRY
All they could find of Pettigrew
was his --
SIRIUS BLACK
Finger. Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was
dead. Then he transformed into a
rat.
(CONTINUED)
98.
114 CONTINUED: (6) 114
Harry stares into Black's sunken eyes. Wanting to
believe. Desperate to believe. Glances at Ron, his
agonized face. Scabbers SQUIRMS VIOLENTLY.
HARRY
Show me.
Lupin and Black turn to Ron. He holds Scabbers
protectively.
RON
What are you going to do to him?
Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.
SIRIUS BLACK
Together.
With that, Lupin takes out his wand and, as one, he and
Black cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. Scabbers twists
madly in midair, then -- FLASH! -- transforms into... a
very short man with thinning hair and grubby hands.
PETER PETTIGREW.
PETTIGREW
S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old
friends.
Neither speaks. Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart
toward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes a
break for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back.
Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry. His
hands flutter nervously, reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER.
PETTIGREW
Harry! Look at you! Y-you look
just like your father. Like
James. We were the best of
friends, he and I --
SIRIUS BLACK
Shut up!
PETTIGREW
I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord,
you have no idea the weapons he
possesses! Ask yourself what you
would have done, Sirius. What
would you have done!

SIRIUS BLACK
Died! Died rather than betray my
friends! And you should have
realized, Peter, if Voldemort
didn't kill you...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
We would.
PETTIGREW
No... please... you can't...
(eyes darting,
finding)
Ron! Haven't I been a good
friend? A good pet? You won't
let them kill me, will you? I was
your rat...
Ron draws back in disgust. Pettigrew turns to Hermione.
PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...
As one, Lupin and Black raise their wands, point them
directly into Pettigrew's face. He shrinks back
trembling, closing his eyes in fear, when...
HARRY
No.
Pettigrew's lids lift. Lupin and Black turn. Staggered.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry, this man...
HARRY
I know what he is. But we'll take
him to the castle.
PETTIGREW
Bless you, boy! Bless you --
HARRY
Get off! I said we'd take you to
the castle. After that, the
Dementors can have you.

117 EXT. WHOMPING WILLOW - NIGHT (LATER) 117
As Pettigrew emerges from the gap, he prattles
desperately:
PETTIGREW
Turn me into a maggot. A dung
beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything
but the Dementors...
(as Ron emerges)
Ron! Haven't I been a good
friend? A good pet? You won't
let them kill me, will you? I was
your rat...
As Ron draws back in disgust, a sleepwalking Snape BUMPS
his head against a low limb. Hermione turns to Harry.
HERMIONE
Don't worry. He's under the
Somnambulist Charm. It's
primarily used to transport the
seriously deranged.
As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.
PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...
Hermione tugs her robes from Pettigrew's sweaty grasp.
Harry turns, sees Black staring in wonder at the castle,
shining radiantly under the bright bowl of the night sky.
SIRIUS BLACK
Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never
forget the first time I walked
through those doors. It'll be
nice to do it again. Freely.
(turning to Harry)
That was a noble thing you did
back there. He doesn't deserve
it.
Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, looks away. Lost in
thought.
HARRY
I don't reckon my father'd want
his best friends to become killers
for a worthless piece of vermin
like Pettigrew. Besides: Dead,
the truth dies with him. Alive...
you're free.
(CONTINUED)

117 CONTINUED: 117
Sirius studies Harry's profile, moved by this.
SIRIUS BLACK
I don't know if you know, Harry,
but when you were born, James and
Lily made me your guardian...
HARRY
I know.
SIRIUS BLACK
And, well, I'll understand if you
choose to stay with your aunt and
uncle, but, so you know, you
could --
HARRY
When!
Come live with you?
SIRIUS BLACK
Soon as my name's cleared...
Harry looks at Hogwarts. GRINS. Sirius does the same.
Then, Hermione's voice rises on the air, quavering with
fear.
HERMIONE
Harry...
He turns, see Hermione staring at the FULL MOON. His
eyes shift. Lupin is a rigid silhouette, his fingers
twitching.
SIRIUS BLACK
Remus, old friend... did you take
your potion tonight?
Lupin, twitching, SHAKES HIS HEAD. Pettigrew's eyes
dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift, note
the WAND trembling in LUPIN'S LENGTHENING FIST.
SIRIUS BLACK
Run. All of you. Now.
But none of them do, transfixed, watching as BRISTLES
POKE THROUGH LUPIN'S SKIN. Black steps forward, wraps
his arms around his friend, presses his mouth to his ear.
SIRIUS BLACK
You know the man you truly are,
Remus. This flesh is only flesh.

SIRIUS BLACK (CONT'Dpounding Lupin's
chest)
This heart is where you truly
live. This heart! Here!
As Lupin's WAND DROPS... Pettigrew LEAPS.
HARRY
No!
(flashing his wand)
Expelliarmus!
Lupin's wand flies from Pettigrew's hand and he FREEZES.
Then slowly turns. Face blank, eyes closed, he... GRINS
HIDEOUSLY. Transforms. Stunned, Harry watches a RAT
dart into the night.
A HOWL PIERCES THE AIR and Harry wheels. With a shrug,
Lupin tosses Black into the air, then turns. He is no
longer human. He's a werewolf. Harry and Hermione begin
to edge back.
HERMIONE
Professor...?
The WEREWOLF'S eyes blaze. Long teeth glitter. Then...
a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat. Harry and
Hermione spin, begin to flee... and run flat into Snape.
As they collapse in a great clumsy pile, Snape's eyes
flutter open, the spell broken. Seeing Hermione atop
him, he sweeps her aside...
SNAPE
Out of the way!
... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
to his feet, Snape draws his wand and steps forward,
shielding Hermione, Harry and Ron.
The WEREWOLF HOWLS, SPRINTS forward, when -- SWOOSH! -- a
GIANT DOG (Black) intercepts it in MIDAIR. They hit the
ground in a FIERCE TANGLE of FLASHING TEETH, a single
horrible flailing beast. Again and again, the dog pushes
the werewolf back, but the werewolf is too strong...
HARRY
Sirius!
The DOG YELPS, ROARS in pain, and the werewolf flings it
into the tall grass. As it charges after, Harry pushes
past Snape, dashes into the night. Hermione makes to
follow, but Snape holds her back.
(CONTINUED)

117 CONTINUED: (3) 117
HERMIONE
Harry!
Harry runs full out. Up ahead, FRAMED AGAINST A FULL
MOON, he spies the dog, lying inert, the werewolf's
razor-sharp claws suspended over its neck.
HARRY
NO!!!
Desperately, Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground
and hurls it with all his might. Bull's-eye. The
werewolf freezes. Turns. Begins to move toward...
Harry.
Harry draws his wand, terrified, but tormented as well,
knowing Lupin dwells somewhere within the beast.
HARRY
Please, Professor. Stop... It's
me.
Suddenly... a HOWL pierces the night.
The werewolf falters, cocking its head toward the forest.
Harry waits, petrified. The WEREWOLF's eyes shift back
to him. It SNARLS, moves closer, ready to kill. Harry
covers his face with his arm, when...
... a SECOND HOWL ECHOES high above the forest. Slowly,
Harry drops his arm. Looks. The werewolf bounds toward
the forest, vanishes. Harry's eyes shift. In the
darkness, the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass.
Falls. Rises. Falls again. Each time becoming more
human. As he disappears over the ridge, Harry sprints
after.
117A EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 117A
Harry stumbles down to Black, who lies on the water's
edge, now fully a man, arms and face gleaming with
lacerations.
HARRY
Sirius!
Harry looks into his glassy eyes.
HARRY
Sirius!
(CONTINUED)
104.
117A CONTINUED: 117A
A fragile MIST escapes Harry's mouth. A raw WIND TOSSES
his hair. CHILL-BUMPS pebble his SKIN. A FRINGE of ICE
appears at the lake's edge. Then they appear, oozing
like smoke through the TREES across the lake. Dementors.
HARRY
No... No!
(drawing his wand)
Expecto... Patronum!
A thin silvery wisp weeps from Harry's wand, hovering
like a VEIL, but the Dementors continue to come. Harry
places his hand on Black's HEAVING HEART, poises his wand
once more:
HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...
Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies. Harry's
eyes flutter, the DEMENTORS twisting madly in his vision,
drawing closer. Black GASPS. SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT
tumble from his lips, as if his very soul were leaving
him...
Then... a LIGHT splinters the trees. Harry squints, sees
a FIERY STAG appear... its body luminous... slashing
through the trees... sowing light in the darkness. The
Dementors wilt in its wake, but more replace them,
sweeping down in waves. Still, the stag charges on. The
LIGHT EXPANDS. The forest blazing with it. The remaining
Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash.
The light ebbs. The stag's luminous body flickers.
There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single
THREAD of LIGHT all that remains, spinning down to the
size of a PEARL... in the palm of MAN, standing deep in
the trees. Harry studies the strangely familiar
SILHOUETTE, then... it is gone.
Silence drops like a curtain. MIST rises from the lake.
As Snape appears at the top of the rise, we --
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
118 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT (LATER) 118
CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... out of HERMIONE'S SHADOW,
which ripples against the curtain that encircles Harry's
bed. A HAND reaches out -- Harry's hand -- and sweeps
the CURTAIN ASIDE. Ron lies opposite, his leg BANDAGED.
Hermione paces. Stops.

118 CONTINUED: 118
HERMIONE
Harry --
HARRY
I saw my dad.
HERMIONE
What...?
HARRY
He sent the Dementors away... I
saw him. Across the lake...
Hermione exchanges a private glance with Ron, turns back.
HERMIONE
Listen, Harry. They've captured
Sirius. Any minute the Dementors
are going to perform the Kiss.
HARRY
The Kiss...?
HERMIONE
It's what Dementors do to those
they want to destroy. They clamp
their jaws over the victim's mouth
and... suck out his soul.
HARRY
You mean, they're going to kill
Sirius?
HERMIONE
No. It's worse. Much worse. You
go on living. But you have no
memory. No sense of self. You're
just a shall. An empty shell...
As Harry reacts, the door opens and Dumbledore enters.
HERMIONE
Headmaster! You've got to stop
them! They've got the wrong man!
HARRY
It's true, sir. Sirius is
innocent --
RON
It's Scabbers who did it!

DUMBLEDORE
Scabbers...?
RON
My rat, sir. Only he's not really
Well, he was a rat. You

see, he used to be my brother
Percy's --
HERMIONE
The point is... we know the truth.
Please, sir, you must believe us.
DUMBLEDORE
I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry
to say the word of three thirteenyear-old
wizards will convince few
others. A child's voice, however
honest and true, is meaningless to
those who have forgotten how to
listen.
As Dumbledore turns to the window, a SHOOTING STAR
plummets silently through the sky.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah... a shooting star. If ever
one was to make a wish, now would
be the time. But time, I'm
afraid, is precisely our
problem...
On cue, the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME... DING!...
DING!
DUMBLEDORE
Mysterious thing, time. Powerful.
And, when meddled with...
dangerous. Sirius Black is in the
topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
(to Hermione)
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen. And you
would, I feel, do well to return
before this last chime. If not...
well, the consequences are really
too ghastly to discuss. Three
turns should do it, I think. If
you succeed, more than one
innocent life may be spared
tonight.

118 CONTINUED: (3) 118
Dumbledore hands Harry and Hermione each a stick of
CHOCOLATE, then starts to go... stops.
DUMBLEDORE
By the way, when in doubt, I find
retracing my steps to be a wise
place to begin... Good luck.
He smiles, exits. Harry glances curiously at the
chocolate.
RON
What in bloody hell was all that
about?
But Hermione doesn't reply, instead looping the pendant's
long chain around Harry's neck as well as her own.
HERMIONE
Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you
can't walk...
As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the BELL
continues to CHIME -- DING! DING! -- and...
119 INT. HOSPITAL WING - TIME REVERSAL - NIGHT/LATE 119
AFTERNOON
TIME REVERSES in a dizzying backward blur, as if a tape
were being rewound, every moment that occurred in the
hospital room flickering by at a dizzying speed while,
outside the window, darkness gives way to dusk and the
sun "un-sets," returning to its place low on the horizon.
At this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is...
Empty. Except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione
unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion.
HARRY
What just happened? Where's Ron?
Hermione ignores the question, eyes the CLOCK on the
wall.
HERMIONE
Seven-thirty. Where were we at
seven-thirty?
HARRY
Huh? Dunno... going to Hagrid's?

Harry and Hermione come to a mad, huffing halt.
HARRY
Hermione! Will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?!
She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry
follows her gaze and BLINKS in DISBELIEF. Across the
grounds...
124 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON 124
... he sees himself, along with Hermione and Ron, about
to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths.
HARRY
But that... that's... us. This is
not... normal.
INTERCUT BETWEEN BRIDGE AND SUNDIAL GARDEN.
Dumbfounded, Harry turns. Hermione holds up the HOURGLASS.
HERMIONE
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first
term. This is how I've been
getting to my lessons all year.
HARRY
You mean, we've gone back in time?
HERMIONE
Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to
return to this moment. Clearly
something happened he wants us to
change.

A soft SMACK is HEARD. They turn, see Malfoy land on
the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rub his
kisser.
HARRY

Good punch.
HERMIONE
Hurry! Malfoy's coming!
Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later,
FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads.
DRACO (O.S.)
Not a word of this to anyone,
understood! I'll get that jumped
up Mudblood one of these days.
Mark my words...
Eyes narrowed in anger, Hermione leans out, reaches up,
and sends Malfoy SPRAWLING. As Harry pulls her back,
Malfoy looks around in confusion, then dashes off with
the others.
Seconds later, Harry emerges, marvels at the sight
of himself and Hermione, and Ron heading down the
slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin
patch.
HARRY
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
HERMIONE
Of course! Remember what
Dumbledore said. If we succeed,
more than one innocent life could
be spared.
HARRY
Buckbeak? But... how will saving
Buckbeak help Sirius?
HERMIONE
We'll see.
125 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT - PUMPKIN PATCH - LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK 125
As Buckbeak feasts on a ferret, Harry and Hermione duck
behind a pile of pumpkins. Peering into the hut, Harry
sees Hermione and Ron embrace awkwardly.

He grins, turns, only to find Hermione analyzing the
moment with considerable fascination. Caught -- regards
Harry defensively.
HERMIONE
What?
HARRY
Nothing.
Harry looks toward the slope, sees Fudge and the others
approaching in a CLOUD of CROWS.
HARRY
Here they come. I better hurry.
HERMIONE
No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him. Otherwise,
he'll think Hagrid set him free!
Harry nods, then looks toward the hut. Inside, Hagrid is
handing Scabbers to Ron.
HARRY
That's Pettigrew --
As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him, speaks
fiercely.
HERMIONE
No, Harry! You can't!
HARRY
Hermione, that's the man who
betrayed my parents! You don't
expect me to just sit here...
HERMIONE
Yes! You Must!
(pointing inside)
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut
right now. If you go bursting
inside, you'll think you've gone
mad. Awful things can happen when
wizards meddle with time. We
can't be seen.
Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing
closer. She frowns, glances into the hut.
(CONTINUED)

125 CONTINUED: (2) 125
HERMIONE
Fudge is coming and... we're not
leaving... why aren't we leaving?
Just then... on the ground beside her... Hermione notices
a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE. Instantly, she grabs it,
rises, and hurls it through the OPEN WINDOW. SMASH! The
sound of a GLASS JAR SHATTERING is heard within the hut.
HARRY
Are you mad?
Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone
through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of
Harry's head.
HARRY
That hurt.
HERMIONE
Sorry.
Crows begin to drop atop the roof. Fudge's party
arrives, RAPS on the door.
HERMIONE
C'mon. Any minute now we're going
to be coming out the back door.
Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly
behind... just in time to see themselves -- along with
Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin
pile where, only seconds before, they were hiding. As
Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before,
Hermione ponders the back of her own head.
HERMIONE
Is that really what my hair looks
like from the back?
HARRY
Shhh!
Hermione sees herself turn. Ducking, she accidentally
stirs the branches, then peeks out and sees herself
staring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY. Next
she hears her own voice:
HERMIONE (O.S.)
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.

125 CONTINUED: (3) 125
Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope.
The coast clear, they slip out of the trees.
HERMIONE
Now, Harry!
As Harry vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at
his ankles, pecking at his feet.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'It is the decision of the
Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures that the
Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter
called the condemned, shall be
executed this day at sundown...'
As Harry approaches, Buckbeak studies him curiously, a
ferret leg dangling from his beak. Harry bows. SLURP!
The ferret leg disappears and Buckbeak returns Harry's
nod. As Harry takes Buckbeak's chain... a flint-eyed
crow PECKS his hand.
HARRY
Get away!
Harry waves the crow away, yanks hard on Buckbeat's
chain.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'The Committee's appointed
executioner shall dispatch the
condemned by means of
beheading...'
HARRY
C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on...
Buckbeak refuses to move.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'As witnessed below.' You sign
here, Hagrid. Very well,
gentlemen. Let's step outside,
shall we...
DING! The Hogwarts BELL begins to TOLL. Harry and
Hermione exchange a glance. Harry tugs harder. No go.
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
Excuse me, Minister. I believe I
must sign as well...

Harry PULLS at the chain, straining mightily...
DING! when Hermione POPS UP, BOWS QUICKLY, and dangles a
dead ferret before Buckbeak.
HERMIONE
Here, Beaky... Come and get the
nice dead ferret... yum yum...
Harry looks at her as if she's mad, but it's... working.
As Buckbeak trots after, the CAWING CROWS scatter.
DING!
Harry and Hermione lead Buckbeak away when the back door
suddenly opens. They freeze... caught... Fudge's eyes
drifting their way, when -- as before -- Dumbledore
raises his hand and directs the attention of the others
away from Buckbeak.
DUMBLEDORE
Professor Dippet had those
blackberries planted when he was
Headmaster...
Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into
the forest... just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Let's get this over with, shall
we?
Harry and Hermione -- their view unobstructed by the LOW
STAND OF TREES this time -- watch the Executioner
approach the pumpkin patch... and stop. Quickly, the
confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
But... where is it? I just saw
the beast not moments ago --
Hagrid?
HAGRID
Beaky...
Hearing Hagrid's husky voice, BUCKBEAK strains at his
tether, WHIMPERS eerily. Hermione tosses him another
ferret.
DUMBLEDORE

How extraordinary!

CORNELIUS FUDGE
Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's
obviously released him.
HAGRID
Professor, I swear! I didn't!
DUMBLEDORE
I'm quite sure the Minister isn't
suggesting that you had anything
to do with it, Hagrid. How could
you? You've been with us all
along.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We should search the grounds --
DUMBLEDORE
Search the skies if you must,
Minister. In the meantime, I
wouldn't say no to a cup of tea,
Hagrid. Or... a large brandy.
(to the Executioner)
It seems your services will no
longer be required.
The Executioner lifts his blade and -- with a brutal fury
-- plunges it into the flesh of a PUMPKIN with a
SICKENING CHOP!
The CROWS SCATTER to the skies.

Look. It's Lupin.
As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence
oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick, pokes
a knot on the trunk. Instantly, the Willow calms.
HARRY
Wait until Fred and George hear
about that one.

As Lupin disappears into the gap at the base of the tree,
Snape makes his way down the slope.

his beak, then -- SLURP! -- is gone.

'Least someone's enjoying himself.
Harry and Hermione sit together in the lengthening

Dementors go away...
HERMIONE
With a Patronus. I heard Snape
telling Dumbledore when we were
taken to the hospital. According
to him, only a really powerful
wizard could have conjured it.
HARRY
It was my Dad.
Hermione looks at Harry.
HARRY
It was my Dad who conjured the
Patronus.
HERMIONE
But, Harry, your Dad's...

Dead. I know. I'm just telling

Harry nods, his voice wistful.
HARRY
When we free him, I'll never have
to go back to the Dursley's. I'm
going to tell him I'd like to live
someplace in the country. I think
he'd like that, after all those
years in Azkaban. We don't need a
big place and I can help him...
A HOWL pierces the night. Hermione glances toward the
Willow.
HERMIONE
It's happened. Lupin's
transformed.
HARRY
Which means Pettigrew is slipping
safely into the night. While we
just stand here...
A FIERCE GROWLING is heard as twin silhouettes -- the DOG
and the WEREWOLF -- bound into the tall grass. Harry
watches himself appear, hurl the stick as before. The
werewolf turns, begins to stalk...
OWWWWWWWWW! Harry wheels, sees Hermione, hands cupped to
her mouth, making a loud HOWL. He covers her mouth.
HARRY
What are you doing?
HERMIONE
Saving your life.
Harry looks back to the tall grass. The werewolf is
frozen. As before, it begins to approach Harry again.
OWWWWWWWW! This time, Harry doesn't stop her.
HARRY
Thanks. But we have to move.
HERMIONE
Why?
HARRY
Because that werewolf you just
called is running right this way.
They exchange a glance and... RUN.

As Harry and Hermione step out, they freeze. The
werewolf poises itself, preparing to pounce, when...
SKREEEK! The TREES shake with the fury of a HURRICANE
and Buckbeak charges into the clearing, screening Harry
and Hermione. The WEREWOLF SNARLS ANGRILY, makes to
charge. With lightning-fast reflexes, Buckbeak's claws
slash the air... only inches from the werewolf's face.
The werewolf stops, eyes glittering with rage, then...
HOWLS. Turning, it vanishes into the forest.

130B CONTINUED: 130B
Shocked.
Terror-stricken.
Opposite them, across the lake...
130C EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME 130C
... a CYCLONE of DEMENTORS whirl madly above Harry and
Black.
INTERCUT BETWEEN BLACK LAKE AND EDGE OF FOREST.
Harry watches himself vainly attempt to conjure a
Patronus as the cyclone only continues to grow...
HERMIONE
This is horrible...
HARRY
Don't worry. My Dad will come...
Right there... you'll see... he'll
come... any minute... he'll
conjure the Patronus
Hermione eyes Harry warily. He is transfixed, staring
hungrily toward the outcrop. The WIND RISES. The Lake
begins to freeze. WHOOSH! WHOOSH! One after another,
Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone...
HERMIONE
No one's coming, Harry...
HARRY
HE WILL! He will come!
She looks. Nothing. Desperately, her eyes flash to the
cyclone, to the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the
water's edge... wracked with pain... dying...
HERMIONE
No one's coming! You're dying,
both of you... and no one's
coming!
Harry's face changes. A riddle unravels. He draws his
wand.
HERMIONE
HARRY, NO!
(CONTINUED)
120.
130C CONTINUED: 130C
Too late. Harry slashes through the trees, down to the
rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father
appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of
Dementors on the other side of the lake.
HARRY
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a MIST,
then BLOOMS MAGNIFICENTLY. The trees EXPLODE WITH LIGHT.
The Lake BLAZES with reflected FIRE. Harry stands
utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the
lake, the Dementors retreat. Harry waits, still as a
statue, until each and every one is gone.
Then he simply lets his arm drop.
131 EXT. HOGWARTS - SKY - FLYING - NIGHT (L ATER) 131
WHOOSH! Harry and Hermione plunge INTO FRAME astride
Buckbeak, SOARING toward the castle. Outside the
grounds, the Dementors wait restlessly. Up ahead, Fudge
and Snape enter the Dark Tower, TORCHES in hand.
HARRY
You were right, Hermione. It
wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It
was... me. I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before. I knew I
could do it this time, because...
because I'd already done it. Does
that make sense?
Hermione contemplates this.
HERMIONE
No.
(looking down
in fear)
But I don't like this!
132 EXT. HOGWARTS - DARK TOWER - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT (MOMENTS 132
LATER)
We see Buckbeak land.
CUT TO:
133 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT 133
Sirius paces within a SMALL CELL, a man condemned.
Spying Harry and Hermione, he stops. Stunned to see
them.
121.
134 INT. DARK TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 134
Snape, TORCH in hand, leads the way as Fudge HUFFS after.
135 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 135
Hermione pushes past Harry.
HERMIONE
Out of the way!
(raising her wand)
Alohomora!
Sirius tests the IRON DOOR. Still locked.
HERMIONE
Didn't really expect that to work.
136 EXT. DARK TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 136
Snape and Fudge draw closer...
137 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 137
Wand flashing, Hermione tries spell after spell.
HERMIONE
Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare!
Emancipare!
No. No. No. No.
SIRIUS BLACK
You might try --
HERMIONE
Quiet! I'm trying to think.
She resumes pacing, MUTTERING furiously. Then... stops.
Turns.
HERMIONE
BOMBARDA!
KA-BOOM! The CELL DOOR ROCKETS to the sky.
SIRIUS BLACK
That'll do.
138 EXT. SKY/HOGWARTS - HELICOPTER SHOT - NIGHT 138
We see Buckbeak spirit Harry, Hermione and Sirius off the
terrace and soar directly TOWARD us... Just as Snape and
Fudge reach the top of the Tower.
122.
139 EXT. BUCKBEAK - FLYING - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 139
Sirius laughs, hair blowing in the wind.
SIRIUS BLACK
You truly are your father's son,
Harry!
140 EXT. CLOCKTOWER COURTYARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 140
Black puts his hands to Hermione's waist, swings her off
Buckbeak and onto the ground next to Harry.
SIRIUS BLACK
I'll be forever grateful for this.
To both of you.
HARRY
I want to go with you.
SIRIUS BLACK
One day perhaps. For some time...
life will be too... unpredictable.
Besides, you're meant to be here.
Black claps his shoulder, looks him in the eye.
SIRIUS BLACK
But promise me something, Harry.
HARRY
Anything.
SIRIUS BLACK
Trust yourself. No matter the
challenges you face -- and I fear
they will be many -- you'll be
surprised how many times you can
find the answers...
(tapping his heart)
...here.
As Sirius climbs atop Buckbeak, a SHOOTING STAR arcs
through the heavens.
SIRIUS BLACK
A shooting star. Make a wish.
WHACK! -- Black gives Buckbeak a SLAP and they soar into
the glittering sky. Harry and Hermione stand watching,
when... DING! They wheel. Look to the Clock Tower.
HERMIONE
We have to go.
(CONTINUED)
123.
140 CONTINUED: 140
As Harry and Hermione dash off, CAMERA TRACKS AFTER,
RISING WITH them as they race up the tower stairway, then
passing through the mechanism and on through to the end
of...

144 INT. CORRIDOR/CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 144
... the corridor. The Clock Tower BELL THUNDERS. The
DOOR OPENS. Dumbledore backs out...
DUMBLEDORE
By the way, when in doubt, I
always find retracing my steps to
be a wise place to begin... Good
luck.
As Dumbledore begins to close the door, Harry and
Hermione stumble frantically forward, the door about to
hit the jamb, when... suddenly... Dumbledore stops.
Looks up.
DUMBLEDORE
Well?
HARRY
He's free -- Sirius. We... we did
it.
DUMBLEDORE
Did what?
With a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the
door. As Harry and Hermione enter.
145 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT ( SAME TIME) 145
... they catch the faintest glimpse of... themselves...
across the room... just as they EVAPORATE. Ron blinks.
Turns. Frowns.
RON
How'd you two get over there? I
was just talking to you... over
there.
(CONTINUED)
124.
145 CONTINUED: 145
Ron glances to the other side of the room. Frowns.
Hermione glances mischievously to Harry.
HERMIONE
What d'you think, Harry? Too much
for him -- everything that's
happened tonight?
HARRY
Afraid so. Always been a bit of
the nervous type, Ron has.
Ron stares at them, confounded. Slowly, they... GRIN.
146 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING 146
The Whomping Willow sways in a light breeze. The Black
Lake shimmers, clouds drifting in its glassy mirror.
147 INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN’S OFFICE - MORNING 147
Harry walks softly toward an OPEN DOOR -- Lupin's
office -- and peers in. Lupin stands over a battered
suitcase, filling it with the last of his books. Without
turning, he SPEAKS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Hello, Harry.
Harry JUMPS. Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Saw you coming.
The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk.
Harry nods, looks back to Lupin. Unable to disguise his
shock at Lupin's appearance.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I've looked worse, believe me.
Harry eyes the open desk drawers... the bare
bookshelves...
HARRY
You've been sacked.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Resigned, actually.
(CONTINUED)
125.
147 CONTINUED: 147
HARRY
Resigned! But why!
PROFESSOR LUPIN
It seems that someone has let slip
the nature of my condition.
HARRY
Snape.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Whoever. It was bound to get out.
This time tomorrow, the owls will
start arriving. Parents will not
want a -- someone like me --
teaching their children.
HARRY
But Dumbledore --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Has already risked enough on my
behalf. Besides, people like me,
well... let's just say I'm used to
this by now. But before I go,
tell me about your Patrons.
HARRY
Well. At first I thought it was a
horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I
think it was --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A stag.
HARRY
Yes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father used to transform into
one. That's how he was able to
keep me company when I became...
sick. He was a great friend
James.
Lupin smiles wanly, lifts his sorry suitcase. Then
stops.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
There are stories about him and your mother, you know.
Some are even true. But I think it's safe to say, in the
end, you'll know them best by getting to know yourself.
Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand.
(CONTINUED)
126.
147 CONTINUED: (2) 147
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Mischief managed.
Harry watches the Map go blank. Looks back. Lupin is
gone.
148 OMITTED 148
149 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 149
Ron stands amid a circle of excited Gryffindors.
RON
Stand back, I said! I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle!
As Harry arrives, he glances at Hermione, who CLEARS HER
THROAT LOUDLY. The others turn, begin all speaking at
once.
NEVILLE
Harry! Wherever did you get it!
SEAMUS
Can I have a go, Harry? After
you, of course --
RON
Quiet!
(as they oblige)
Thank you. Let the man through.
Mystified, Harry steps forward, the boys peeling away,
clearing his view of the BROOMSTICK in Ron's hands. The
LABEL GLEAMS: "FIREBOLT."
HARRY
Whose is that?
RON
(as everyone laughs)
Whose is it? It's yours, mate.
HARRY
Who?
But... how?
HERMIONE
It's a mystery. Though... this
fell out of the wrapping.
Harry turns, sees Hermione holding up a FEATHER.
(CONTINUED)
127.
149 CONTINUED:

HARRY
That's a Hippogriff feather --
As Harry stops short, Hermione raises her eyebrow. As
they share a secret glance, we...
CUT TO:
150 INT./EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FRONT DOORS - DAY
150
BOOM! The huge vertical DOORS BURST OPEN and Harry,
trailed by the others, exits with the Firebolt. As he
strides off, others join the assembly -- Hagrid, Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle among them -- curious to see what the
commotion is all about.
151 EXT. COURTYARD - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
151
As Harry stops, an expectant HUSH hangs over the moment.
SEAMUS
Go on, Harry.
NEVILL E
Yeah. Let's see.
Harry mounts the broom. Licks his finger and jabs it in
the air. A few others do the same. Hagrid does the
same. Crabbe and Goyle start to do the same, when Malfoy
SLAPS their hands down. Finally, Harry places his hand
on the broom. Sets his grip. Takes a breath. And...
Frowns.
FRED/GEORGE
What's wrong?
HARRY
I don't think it works. I think
it's defective.
A collective GROAN. Dejected, many of the kids begin to
drift toward the castle. Harry calls after.
HARRY
Oh, come on now. It's just a
broom.
HAGRID
(nodding sagely)
Just a broom.
(CONTINUED)
128.
151 CONTINUED: 151
Harry's eye shifts to Ron and Hermione. A wink.
HARRY
The fastest broom in the world.
As everyone turns -- WHOOSH! -- Harry JETS OFF and we --
CUT TO:
152 EXT. HIGH IN THE SKY - DAY (SAME TIME) 152
A tiny DOT, GROWING LARGER AND LARGER, races upward.
It's Harry shooting straight into the blue on the
Firebolt. A SCREAM GROWS LOUDER as he approaches. A
scream of release, of utter abandon. It's Harry
screaming. But something else is clear as he JETS PAST
and...
The SCREEN GOES BLACK.
It's a SCREAM of joy.
FADE OUT.
THE END

CHAPTER 4



1 EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 1
The street slumbers, adrift in shadow. Then... a curious
BEAM OF LIGHT BOBS beyond the second-story window of
Number Four.
2 INT. HARRY’S ROOM - SAME TIME - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 2
A tent of blankets. Within... the SHADOW of a BOY. A
WHISPER:
HARRY
Lumos Maxima...
The tent BLOOMS SOFTLY with light -- briefly illuminating
a bedside PHOTOGRAPH (of James & Lily Potter) -- then
goes dark.
HARRY
Lumos Maxima...
The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a
TOILET FLUSHES. Instantly, the SHADOW stiffens, the
blankets DIM, and the tent flattens. Just as...
... the bedroom door OPENS, revealing... UNCLE VERNON.
He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then...
withdraws.
The tent rises.
HARRY
Lumos Maxima...
As the blankets blaze, we CUT INSIDE, find a SKINNY BOY
with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting
crookedly atop his nose: HARRY POTTER. Open before him
is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he
speaks:
HARRY
Lumos... MAXIMA!
2A EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 2A
A BLINDING BLAST OF LIGHT FLASHES from the second story
window of Number Four. DOGS BARK. And a TITLE CARD
appears:
HARRY POTTER
and the
Prisoner of Azkaban
3.
2B INT. HARRY’S ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 2B
The light in the hallway SNAPS on, Harry's tent droops
once more and, seconds later, Harry's door eases open.
Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. The
room is utterly SILENT. Slowly, he closes the door.

6 INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - STAIRWAY/FRONT HALL - DAY 6
The DOORBELL CHIMES and a shrill VOICE THUNDERS:
AUNT PETUNIA (O.S.)
Harry!
Harry!
Harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall,
where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly.
Petunia flicks a bit of fluff from Dudley's sweater,
glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the
door.
AUNT PETUNIA
Well, go on. Open it.
Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS
OPEN, revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and
a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle Vernon lurches
forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in
hand, and drops it on Harry.
AUNT PETUNIA
Marge! Welcome! How was the
train?
AUNT MARGE
Wretched. Ripper got sick.
AUNT PETUNIA
Ah. How... unfortunate.
AUNT MARGE
I would've left him with the
others, but he pines so when I'm
away. Don't you, darling?
Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down
the hallway. Harry follows with Uncle Vernon.
(CONTINUED)

6 CONTINUED: 6
HARRY
Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign
this form.
UNCLE VERNON
What is it?
HARRY
Nothing. Something for school...
Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in Harry's hand
suspiciously.
UNCLE VERNON
Later perhaps. If you behave.
HARRY
I will if she does.
AUNT MARGE
(turning, eyeing Harry)
So. Still here, are you?
HARRY
Yes.
AUNT MARGE
Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful
tone. Damn good of my brother to
keep you, if you ask me.
(to Vernon, Petunia)
It'd have been straight to an
orphanage if he'd been dumped on
my doorstep.
Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV --
emits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.
AUNT MARGE
Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that
my neffy poo? Come and say hello
to your Auntie Marge.
Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks,
waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently.
Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his
ankle.
7 INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DINING ROOM - DUSK 7
As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a
bottle of brandy.
(CONTINUED)

7 CONTINUED: 7
UNCLE VERNON
Can I tempt you, Marge?
AUNT MARGE
Just a small one. A bit more... a
bit more... That's the boy.
(taking a
sloppy sip)
Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia.
It's normally just a fry-up for
me, what with twelve dogs.
She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Ripper
take a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catches
Harry looking.
AUNT MARGE
What are you smirking at! Where
is it that you send him, Vernon?
UNCLE VERNON
St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases.
Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who
glares darkly at him.
AUNT MARGE
I see. And do they use the cane
at St. Brutus's, boy?
HARRY
(sarcastically)
Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads
of times.
AUNT MARGE
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense
about not hitting people who
deserve it.
(another sip)
Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
how this one's turned out, Vernon.
It all comes down to blood. Bad
blood will out. What is it the
boy's father did, Petunia?
AUNT PETUNIA
(agitated)
Nothing. That is... he didn't
work. He was -- unemployed.
(CONTINUED)
6.
7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
AUNT MARGE
Of course. And a drunk,
I expect --
HARRY
That's a lie.
Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.
AUNT MARGE
What did you say?
HARRY
My dad wasn't a drunk.
POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.
AUNT PETUNIA
Oh my goodness! Marge!
AUNT MARGE
Not to worry, Petunia. I have a
very firm grip.
Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise.
UNCLE VERNON
You go to bed. Now.
AUNT MARGE
Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter
about the father. In the end it
comes down to the mother. You see
it all the time with dogs. If
there's something wrong with the
bitch, there'll be something wrong
with the pup...
HARRY
Shut up! Shut up!
Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON on
her dress sails into the air. SEAMS GROAN. THREAD
SNAPS. Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN. Her cheeks BILLOW. Her
whole body BILLOWS. And she begins to INFLATE like a
MONSTROUS BALLOON.
UNCLE VERNON
MARGE!
As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her. RIPPER GROWLS,
fixes his teeth to his trousers. Harry frightened by
what he's done, watches Aunt Marge BOUNCE GENTLY across
the ceiling and into the CONSERVATORY.
7.
7A EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 7A
The others race outside. As Aunt Marge begins to float
away, Uncle Vernon grips her hands.
UNCLE VERNON
Don't worry! I've got you...
Slowly... to his horror... Uncle Vernon himself begins to
RISE. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes...
AUNT MARGE
Vernon. Don't you dare --
But he does. He lets go. Falls to his knees. And
watches Aunt Marge float away.
8 INT. HARRY’S ROOM - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 8
Harry crashes inside, takes his TRUNK, then puts his heel
to a LOOSE FLOORBOARD and removes his WAND from its
hiding place. Turning, he grabs the PHOTOGRAPH of his
parents.
9 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the TRUNK down the
stairs... finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him.
UNCLE VERNON
YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER
BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!
HARRY
No! She deserved what she got!
And you... you keep away from me.
Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with
knowing cruelty.
UNCLE VERNON
You're not allowed to do magic out
of school. They won't have you
now. You've got nowhere to go.
Harry realizes it's true. Briefly falters. Then:
HARRY
Anywhere's better than here.
9A EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9A
As Harry storms out with his trunk, we DOLLY TO the
street WITH him. High in the sky, a plump DOT rises.
Aunt Marge.
8.
10 EXT. MAGNOLIA CRESCENT - NIGHT (LATER) 10
Harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops. Glances
about. An empty PLAYGROUND. SWINGS CREAKING gently on
rusted chains. A tiny CAROUSEL, kissed gently by the
wind, turning slowly.
Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Deep in the night, an
ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT. Harry, still as a statue.
Listening. In the trees above, LEAVES TREMBLE. The WIND
gathers.
Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.
Then, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something in
the shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draws
his wand.
Then he sees... it. Something BIG. Darker than the
shadows which conceal it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING
EYES.
Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Afraid not to. Wand
outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten
trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES.
BANG! TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night.
HARRY
Aaaah!
GIANT WHEELS bear down. Harry rolls clear -- just as a
PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a
halt. GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the windscreen: The
Knight Bus.
DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18-
year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty
face. Raccoon eyes. Stan looks like he hasn't seen the
sun in years.
STAN SHUNPIKE
(wearily, drearily)
Welcome to the Knight Bus.
Emergency transport for the
stranded witch or wizard. My name
is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this evening.
(peering at Harry)
Wha' choo doin' down there?
HARRY
Fell over.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Wha' choo fall over for?
(CONTINUED)

10 CONTINUED: 10
HARRY
I didn't do it on purpose.
Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Well, come on then. Let's not
wait for the grass to grow.
As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows
across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs
aboard.
11 INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 11
No seats. Only BEDS. The BRASS frames need a shine, the
lines a wash. In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS,
turns over in his sleep.
DISHEVELED WIZARD
Not now... I'm pickling slugs...
Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK
GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with
sweat. A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror,
MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace its
mouth.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Take 'er away, Ern.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Yeah, take it away!
BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide
six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed
nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly
above his head. Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC
WHIPS past in a blur.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Wot you say your name was again?
HARRY
I didn't.
Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily
Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once
more. Harry brushes the fringe of his hair over his
scar, watches an AMBULANCE -- SIREN WAILING -- careen
past.
(CONTINUED)
10.
11 CONTINUED: 11
STAN SHUNPIKE
Whereabouts you headin'?
Harry hesitates. He hadn't thought about this. Decides.
HARRY
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in
London --
STAN SHUNPIKE
Is it now? Get that, Ern? The
Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from
the pea soup!
As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers
out the windscreen, watches London careering by.
HARRY
Isn't this a bit... dangerous?
STAN SHUNPIKE
Naah. Haven't had an accident
in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Heads up! Little old lady at
twelve o'clock!
Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is
crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and
Harry flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes
pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and
Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets
forward once more.
As Harry rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of
Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a
sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a
MOVING PHOTOGRAPH.
HARRY
Who is that? That man.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Who is that? That's Sirius Black,
that is. Don' tell me you ne'er
been hearin' o' Sirius Black?
(CONTINUED)
11.
11 CONTINUED: (2) 11
Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face.
STAN SHUNPIKE
A murderer, he is. Got 'imself
locked up in Azkaban for it.
HARRY
How'd he escape?
STAN SHUNPIKE
Tha's the question, isn't it?
He's the firs' that's done it.
Gives me the collywobbles thinking
he's out there, though, I'll tell
you that. Big supporter of YouKnow-'Oo,
Black was. Reckon you
heard o' him.
Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Meet
Harry's.
HARRY
Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly
toward the Knight Bus. Before can scream, the entire
Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the
two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Hate that.
HARRY
This bus. Don't the Muggles ever...
STAN SHUNPIKE
Them! Don' listen properly, do
they? Don' look properly either.
Never notice nuffink, they don'.
Just then, a COUPLE walking a DOG are engulfed by a RUSH
of WIND as the (invisible) Knight Bus WHOOSHES past. The
couple glances about in bewilderment. The DOG YAPS
madly.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Turn! Turn!
Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a
dizzying 360-degree turn. HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the
windows as the bus rides up on two wheels and Harry is
sent flying once more. Grabbing fast to the center POLE,
he pirouettes through the air when Ernie... SLAMS on the
BRAKES.
12.
12 EXT. CHARING CROSS ROAD/LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT 12
The Knight Bus fishtails INTO VIEW and SQUEALS to a stop,
centimeters from a PARKED CAR. WHOOSH! The bus settles
and -- TINK! -- taps the bumper. Instantly, the car's
ALARM wails.
12A INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 12A
The chandelier sways drunkenly as the bus doors open.
The steps GROAN with heavy feet and a FIGURE appears:
TOM, Innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron pub.
TOM
Mr. Potter... at last.
12B EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 12B
As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are
revealed, Harry glances up, reads the SIGN above: THE
LEAKY CAULDRON. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then
pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car
alarm.
13 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BAR/HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS 13
LATER)
Harry trails Tom through the quiet room. The BARTENDER
glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A
solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his
COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF. Tom leads Harry upstairs.
14 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BACK ROOM - NIGHT 14
As Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a SNOW WHITE OWL
(HEDWIG) perched atop a chair.
HARRY
Hedwig!
TOM
Right smart bird you've got there,
Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes
before yourself.
A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED
SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE) at the window, staring at
the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers
in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a
position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his
palms.

14 CONTINUED: 14
CORNELIUS FUDGE
I should tell you, Mr. Potter,
earlier this evening your uncle's
sister was located just south of
Sheffield, circling a chimney
stack. The Accidental Magic
Reversal Department was dispatched
and she's been properly punctured
and
her memory modified. She has no
recollection of the incident
whatsoever.
Harry waits. A man condemned. Then Fudge turns.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
So that's that, and no harm done.
(smiling)
Pea soup?
Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to
Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut
sliver.
HARRY
No thank you. Minister... I don't
understand. I broke the law.
Underage wizards aren't allowed to
use magic at home --
CORNELIUS FUDGE
(dishing up a bowl)
Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban for
blowing up their aunts! On the
other hand... running away like
that... given the state of
things... very, very
irresponsible.
HARRY
'The state of things' sir?
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.
HARRY
Sirius Black, you mean. But...
what's that got to do with me?
CRACK! Tom SHATTERS another WALNUT. Fudge smiles
nervously.
(CONTINUED)
14.
14 CONTINUED: (2) 14
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Hm? Oh, nothing. You're safe,
that's what matters. Tomorrow
you'll be on your way to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them
brought here for you.
Harry eyes the STACK of BOOKS. One is bound by a ROPE.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
By the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here it would be best if you
didn't... wander.
15 OMITTED 15
16 EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING 16
THROUGH the window: the rooftops of London. A TRAIN
PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Harry, standing
with Hedwig. He turns, eyes his schoolbooks. He studies
the GROWLING TOME -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then
gives the rope a tug. Instantly...
... the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers
SNAPPING. Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins
NIPPING viciously at his shoes. Harry vaults atop the
bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a
PILLOW.
Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry
POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled
beneath the pillow. Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to
rebind it.
17 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - HALLWAY/ROOMELEVEN - MORNING 17
A YOUNG WITCH in maid's robes pushes a cart down the
hall. Harry exits his room as the witch KNOCKS on a
door.
YOUNG WITCH
Housekeeping.
As she opens the door, she's greeted by a THUNDEROUS ROAR
and a RUSH of WIND.
YOUNG WITCH
(unperturbed)
I'll come back later.

Something SMALL and FAST dashes by Harry's feet.

As Harry moves down the stairs, VOICES come from below.
RON (O.S.)
I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep
that bloody beast of yours away
from Scabbers or I'll turn it into
a tea cozy.
HERMIONE (O.S.)
He's a cat, Ronald! What do you
expect? It's in his nature.
As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY
protectively cradling Scabbers, while HERMIONE GRANDER
does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks.
RON
A cat! Is that what they told
you? Looks more like a pig with
hair if you ask me.
HERMIONE
That's rich coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.
(cooing to the cat)
It's all right, Crookshanks. You
just ignore the mean little boy...
Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.
HERMIONE/RON
Harry.

As Ron smoothes the dog-eared clipping onto the table,
Harry studies it. Hermione ignores it, stroking
Crookshanks.
HARRY
Egypt! What's it like?
RON
Brilliant. It's got loads of old
stuff. Mummies. Death masks.
Tombs --
HERMIONE
You know, the ancient Egyptians of
the Nile River delta worshipped
the cat goddess Bast.
Ron glares stonily at Hermione, then turns back to Harry.
RON
I also got a new wand.
Just then, a COMMOTION is HEARD. The Weasleys -- PERCY,
FRED, GEORGE, GINNY, ARTHUR, and MOLLY -- arrive en
masse, laden with purchases from Diagon Alley.
GEORGE
Not flashing that clipping about
again, are you, Ron?
RON
I haven't shown anyone!
FRED
No, not a soul. Unless you count
Tom. The day maid. The night
maid. The cook. The bloke that
came to fix the toilet. That
wizard from Belgium...
Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands, smiles. As
if relieved to see him.
MRS. WEASLEY
It's good to see you, Harry.
(CONTINUED)

23A CONTINUED: 23A
HARRY
Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. I wonder if I might have a
word.
HARRY
Of course, Mr. Weasley.
As Mr. Weasley pulls Harry away, the others continue to
hover over the clipping in the b.g.
FRED
George's nose looks positively
massive in that photograph.
GINNY
That's your nose, Fred.
FRED
Bloody hell. 'Tis, isn't it?
Take after your side of the
family, don't I, Mum?
Harry notices Mr. Weasley glance edgily at a FUGITIVE
POSTER tacked to the wall. In it, SIRIUS BLACK glowers
under the words, "Have You Seen This Man?"
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. There are some within the
Ministry who would strongly
discourage me from divulging what
I'm about to tell you. But I
think you need to know the facts.
Because you're in danger. Grave
danger.
Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.
HARRY
Has this anything to do with him,
sir?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
What do you know of Sirius Black,
Harry?
HARRY
That he escaped from Azkaban.
That he killed someone...

ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry, thirteen years ago, when
you stopped...
Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue.
HARRY
Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
(nodding nervously)
Black lost everything. But he
remains a loyal servant to this
day. In his mind, only you stand
in the way of...
Once again, Mr. Weasley hesitates.
HARRY
Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry, I hate it when you say --
HARRY
I know, sorry. Ron hates it too.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
In Black's mind, only you stand in
the way of... You-Know-Who
returning to power. That's why
he's broken. That's why he's
broken out of Azkaban. To find
you. And...
Mr. Weasley hesitates yet again.
HARRY
Kill me?
Mr. Weasley nods. Nervously.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. I want you to swear
that -- whatever you might hear --
you won't go looking for Black.
HARRY
Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?
Mr. Weasley nods, then claps Harry on the shoulder.

Weasley dashes through the throng and up to an open train
window.
MRS. WEASLEY
Ron!
She hands Scabbers through the open window to him.
27 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - TRAIN CAR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 27
The aisle teems with students. Harry, Ron and Hermione
work their way down the aisle, looking for an empty
compartment.
HARRY
I didn't mean to blow her up. I
just...
(troubled by
the memory)
... lost control.
RON
Brilliant!
HERMIONE
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.
RON
I still think it was brilliant.
SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! A copy of the The Monster Book of
Monsters SCUTTLES CRAB-LIKE down the aisle, pursued by
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM.
NEVILLE

HARRY/HERMIONE/RON
Hi, Neville.
As he bumps past, Hermione nods to a compartment.
HERMIONE
C'mon. We're in here.
28 INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY 28
As they slip inside, they find a MAN in SHABBY ROBES
(PROFESSOR LUPIN) slumped against the window, asleep. He
looks ill, exhausted. The trio eye him warily. WHISPER.
RON
Who d'you reckon he is?
HERMIONE
Professor R.J. Lupin.
RON
You know everything. How is it
she knows everything?
HERMIONE
It's on his case.
She points. Stamped in peeling letters on a BATTERED
CASE is "Professor R.J. Lupin."
HARRY
Is he really asleep?
HERMIONE
Seems to be. Why? What is it,
Harry?
HARRY
Close the door.
Hermione and Ron exchange a curious glance, then Ron
rises, slides the door shut, OVER CAMERA, and we --

30 INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - LATE DAY 30
Ron and Hermione stare at Harry, faces stricken in the
lantern light that now glows in the compartment.
Crookshanks slumbers in his CAGE.
RON
Let me get this straight. Sirius
Black escaped from Azkaban to come
after you?
HARRY
Yes.
HERMIONE
But they'll catch Black, won't
they? I mean... eventually?
RON
Sure -- Of course, no one's ever
broken out of Azkaban before and
he's a raving, murderous
lunatic...
Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker.
The train LURCHES, begins to SLOW. Hermione slides down
the seat, pinning Ron against the window. They exchange
an awkward glance, then Hermione carefully slides to the
other end of the seat and glances at her WATCH. Frowns.
HERMIONE
Why're we stopping? We can't be
there yet...
Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the
corridor.
HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out
curiously. Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS --
and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...

A thin WISP of STEAM escapes Ron's mouth. Harry notices.
HARRY
Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?
HERMIONE
Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!
SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK. Ron, a dark silhouette against the
window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.
RON
There's something moving out
there. I think... people are
coming aboard.
Suddenly the CAR SWAYS violently... rights itself. The
METAL WINDOW TRIM at Ron's fingertips begins to VIBRATE.
RON
Bloody hell. What's happening?
SSSSST! A soft CRACKLING fills the car and FLAMES
bloom... in the hands of R.J. Lupin. In the SHIVERING
LIGHT, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are
alert. Wary.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Don't. Move.
A HAND -- slimy and scabbed -- a hand of death -- GRIPS
the half-open compartment door, pushes it aside.
REVEALS: a TOWERING, CLOAKED FIGURE, its face hidden
beneath its black hood. CROOKSHANKS' hair rises and as
she HISSES...
WHOOSHHHHH. The folds of the hood TREMBLE. A CHILL,
RATTLING INTAKE OF AIR is heard. The FLAMES in Lupin's
hands SPUTTER. A SOUND SWELLS in Harry's ears. Eerie.
Painful. The sound of a WOMAN SCREAMING. Harry's eyes
roll up, eyelids fluttering.
And then... a SILVERY WHITE LIGHT drifts from his mouth.
The world spins off its axis and Harry falls... glasses
tumbling hard to the ground... then Harry... the muscles
of his jaw twitching. THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTNING paints
the ICY windows...

With a DESPERATE GASP, Harry opens his eyes. Blinks.
DUSK IS GONE. The windows BLACK. The floor at his spine
is SHAKING GENTLY. The train moving again. His eyes
shift, see a DROP OF WATER, newly unfrozen, running
slowly down the window.
HERMIONE
Harry? Harry, are you all right?
Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. He nods.
Sits up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand.
Harry's glasses.
HARRY
Thanks.
Harry slips them on. Discovers the cold sweat glazing
his brow. SNAP! Professor Lupin breaks a ragged
triangle of CHOCOLATE off the SLAB in his hands. Holds
it out.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Chocolate. Eat. It'll help.
HARRY
What was that -- that thing?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Dementor. One of the guards of
Azkaban. It's gone now.
Harry frowns in confusion.
HERMIONE
It was searching the train, Harry.
For Sirius Black.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I need to have a word with the
driver. Excuse me.

RON
No. I felt... weird. Like I'd
never be cheerful again. But...
no.
Harry turns to Hermione. She shakes her head.
HERMIONE
I was trembling. Cold. But
then... Professor Lupin made it go
away...
HARRY
But someone was screaming. A
woman.
Hermione and Ron glance nervously at each other.

At the High Table, Lupin sits with SEVERUS SNAPE, MINERVA
McGONAGALL, RUBEUS HAGRID and ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. We TRACK
ALONG the FACES of the choir, singing to the strains of a
HARPSICHORD, and LAND ON a QUINTET OF TOADS (one of
which -- TREVOR -- belongs to NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, who
looks on with pride).
ARGUS FILCH, Hogwarts' caretaker, stands grimly to the
side as red-eyed MRS. NORRIS switches her tail at his
feet. As the choir's song concludes, DUMBLEDORE rises,
beaming over the sea of black hats.
DUMBLEDORE
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts! I have a few things
to say, before we become befuddled
by our excellent feast. I myself
am particularly looking forward to
the flaming kiwi cups, which,
while somewhat treacherous for
those of us with facial hair...
McGONAGALL clears her throat.
DUMBLEDORE
Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to
welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who
has kindly consented to fill the
post of Defense Against the Dark
Arts. Good luck to you,
Professor.
Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLAP
LOUDLY.
HERMIONE
Of course! That's why he knew to
give you the chocolate, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE
As some of you may know, Professor
Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
Creatures teacher for many years,
has decided to retire in order to
spend more time with his remaining
limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted
to announce that his place will be
filled by none other than our own
Rubeus Hagrid!

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stare at each other --
stunned -- then APPLAUD vigorously. Hagrid turns ruby
red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sending
water goblets weaving.
DUMBLEDORE
(turning grave)
Finally, on a more disquieting
note, Hogwarts -- at the request
of the Ministry of Magic -- will,
until further notice, play host to
the Dementors of Azkaban.
A MURMUR of apprehension fills the hall. At the
Slytherin table, DRACO MALFOY, flanked by the ever
present CRABBE and GOYLE, catches Harry's eye, feigns
a dead faint.
DUMBLEDORE
The Dementors will be stationed at
the entrances to the grounds. While
they are under strict orders not to
enter the castle itself, you will on
occasion see them as you go about
your daily activities. Under no
circumstances are you to approach
them. It is not in the nature of
a Dementor to be forgiving.

As BRIDGE and CASTLE glimmer in the distance, Hagrid

BIRDBATH, finally coming to rest upon...

Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside.

rash tomorrow morning, dear.

Mr. Longbottom, after you've
broken your first cup...
CA-CHINK! Neville fumbles the cup in his hands and the
brittle CRASH of CHINA is heard.

LAVENDER
'Taking the form of a giant

That's a fascinating subject.
RON
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking this term?
HERMIONE
A fair few.
RON
Hang on. Ancient Runes is the

Hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this side
of the Forbidden Forest. In the paddock, a freestanding
IRON RACK hangs with DEAD FERRETS, BUZZING with FLIES.
Nearby is a PUMPKIN PATCH.

of Monsters, which QUIVER VIOLENTLY.
HAGRID

Hagrid takes Hermione's copy, SNAPS the Spellotape
binding it. As it begins to BITE, Hagrid calmly runs a
forefinger down the book's spine and it... SHIVERS.
Falls quietly open.
Hagrid glances at the class, looking suddenly unsure.
HAGRID
Righ' then. So... so... yeh've

the Magical Creatures. Right.
So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em.
Hagrid turns, disappears into the trees. Draco shakes

Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching
classes.
HARRY
Listen, you stupid prat --

DRACO
Potter, there's a Dementor behind

Harry JUMPS, wheels in fear, finds... nothing. Instantly,
the SLYTHERINS make an eerie OOH... and OOH sound, then
break up laughing. Harry reddens, embarrassed, then...
A STRANGE BEAST (BUCKBEAK) emerges from the trees. It
has the torso, hind legs, and tail of a horse, but the
front legs, wings and head of a giant eagle. The
students step back in fear, then Hagrid appears, shooing
the beast on.
HAGRID
Gee up, there!
(grinning)
Beau'iful, isn' he?
(CONTINUED)
33.
44 CONTINUED: (2) 44
There seems no consensus on this, but the students stare
in wary wonder nonetheless. As Hagrid coaxes the beast
to the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily.
RON
Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
HAGRID
A Hippogriff, o' course. Now,
firs' thing yeh gotta know is
they're proud. Easily offended,
Hippogriffs are. Don't never
insult one, 'cause it migh' be
the las' thing yeh do. Right
then -- who wants ter come an'
say hello?
The entire class STEPS BACK, leaving Harry in front.
HAGRID
Good man, Harry!
Harry looks around, then -- reluctantly -- approaches.
HAGRID
Tha's it. Easy now... stop! This
here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want
ter let 'im make the firs' move.
It's polite, see? Jus' take step
forward, give 'im a bow, and if
Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed
ter touch him. Ready?
Unsure, Harry nods anyway. Steps forward. And... bows.
Buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily.
Harry waits. And waits...
HAGRID
Back off, Harry! Back off!
Harry starts to step back, when... Buckbeak ducks his
beak. Hagrid sighs, relieved.
HAGRID
Well done, Harry! Go on. Give
'im a pat.
Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand on
Buckbeak's fierce beak. The class CLAPS. Harry
smiles.
(CONTINUED)
34.
44 CONTINUED: (3) 44
HAGRID
Look at that! I reckon he migh'
let yeh ride 'im!
HARRY
(smile drooping)
Excuse me?
HAGRID
We'll jus' set yeh behind the
wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull
any feathers out. He won' like
that.
Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's
back, and before Harry's settled, SLAPS Buckbeak's
hindquarters.
HAGRID
Off yeh go!
As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back,
giant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! --
they SOAR into the air. Rising higher. And higher.
And higher.
Gradually, Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeak's neck.
Losing himself in the joy of flying. Smiling at the
sight of his and Buckbeak's SHADOW racing across the
grass below. Circling over the Whomping Willow, past
Hogwarts castle, and then SWOOPING, with heart-stopping
speed, over the Black Lake, Buckbeak's talons tickling
the smooth glass of the water, summoning the GIANT SQUID
to the surface briefly. Hagrid WHISTLES then, and
Buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock,
galloping to a halt. As Harry slides off, the class
CHEERS -- all except Draco, who narrows his eyes
maliciously.
HAGRID
Good work, Harry!
(under his breath)
How'm I doin' me firs' day?
HARRY
Brilliant... Professor.
They both grin, when Draco pushes past them roughly,
strides toward Buckbeak.
(CONTINUED)

44 CONTINUED: (4) 44
DRACO
Give me a go at that thing. If
Potter can do it, it must be
easy. You're not dangerous at
all, are you, you great ugly
brute --
HAGRID
Malfoy! No!
In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfoy
freezes. Looks down at the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his
robes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward.
Buckbeak WHIPS AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing
Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry...
realizing what he's done... breathes.
DRACO
It's killed me! It's killed
me!
HAGRID
Calm yerself! Yer fine... jus'
a scratch...
Hagrid looks: a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp
arm.
HERMIONE
Hagrid. He's got to be taken to
a hospital. I'll go with you,
if you like --
HAGRID
No. I'm the teacher. You all...
you all just... Class dismissed!
And with that, Hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up
Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers
toward the castle.
45 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 45
As Lavender and Parvati huddle over a DOZEN TEACUPS,
Avidly interpreting patterns in HUSHED VOICES, Draco,
arm bound in a SLING, holds court before a clot of
Slytherins.
PANSY
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

DRACO
(a tad theatrical)
It comes and goes. Still... I
consider myself lucky. According
to Madam Pomfrey, another minute
or two... and I could've lost the
arm.
Harry, Ron and Hermione watch from the Gryffindor table.
RON
The little git. He's really
laying it on thick, isn't he?
HARRY
At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.
HERMIONE
Yes. But I hear Draco's father's
furious. I don't think we've
heard the end of this...
SEAMUS
He's been sighted!
They turn. Seamus and the other Gryffindors are huddled
over a copy of The Daily Prophet.
RON
Who?
But the PHOTOGRAPH on the Prophet's front page provides a
chilling answer: Sirius Black. Hermione reads over the
shoulders of others. WHISPERS half to herself:
HERMIONE
Achintee? That's not far from
here...
NEVILLE
You don't think he'd come to
Hogwarts, do you?
LAVENDER
With the Dementors at every
entrance?
LAVENDAR
Dementors? He's already slipped
by them once, hasn't he? Who's
to say he can't do it again?
(CONTINUED)

45 CONTINUED: (2) 45
As a flicker of fear passes through Harry's face, BEM,
a Nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of
Black.
BEM
That's right. Black could be
anywhere. It's like trying to
catch smoke. Like trying to
catch smoke with your bare
hands.
46 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING 46
Beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then, slowly

49 INT. LUPIN’S CLASSROOM - MORNING 49
A tall WARDROBE RATTLES VIOLENTLY as Harry, Ron and
several classmates regard it warily.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Intriguing, yes? Would anyone
like to venture a guess as to
what's inside?
SEAMUS
(in a hushed voice)
That's a Boggart, that is.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can
anyone tell us what a Boggart
looks like?
HERMIONE
No one knows.
Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry.
RON
When'd she get here?
(CONTINUED)
38.
49 CONTINUED: 49
HERMIONE
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever
a particular person fears most.
That's what makes it so --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Terrifying, yes. Luckily, a very
simple charm exists to repel a
Boggart. Let's practice it now,
shall we? Without wands,
please... Riddikulus!
STUDENTS
Riddikulus!
DRACO
(muttering softly)
It's this class that's ridiculous.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Good. So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone
is not enough. What really
finishes a Boggart off is...
laughter. You need to force it
to assume a shape you find truly
amusing. Neville, come up here,
will you?
Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe, steps forward
queasily.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
What would you say is the thing
that frightens you most?
NEVILLE
Profter... Snafpt...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry.
NEVILLE
Professor Snape.
Everyone LAUGHS good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Hmmm... yes. Neville, I believe
you live with your grandmother?
(CONTINUED)
39.
49 CONTINUED: (2) 49
NEVILLE
Yes, but I don't want the Boggart
to turn into her either.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
It won't. But I want you to
picture her clothes, only her
clothes, very clearly in your
mind. Can you do that?
NEVILLE
(closing his eyes)
She carries a red handbag...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's fine. We don't need to
hear it. If you see it, we will.
Now, when I open this wardrobe,
Neville, here's what I want you to
do...
Lupin leans close to Neville, WHISPERS. Neville's eyes
POP OPEN in shock. Consider Lupin uncertainly.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You can do this, Neville.
Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Right then. Wand at the ready.
One. Two. Three!
SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and
the wardrobe BURSTS OPEN. Instantly, Snape appears, eyes
flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs
away in fright.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Think, Neville. Think!
NEVILLE
R-r-riddikulus!
CRACK! Snape stumbles in a FLASH OF LIGHT and
reappears... in a LONG, LACE-TRIMMED DRESS, TOWERING
MOTH-EATEN HAT, and CRIMSON HANDBAG. Instantly, the
class ROARS (except for Draco and his fellow Slytherins).
Neville blinks, amazed, then slowly, grins himself.
Lupin drops the needle on an OLD GRAMAPHONE. As a
SCRATCHY RHUMBA fills the room, he points to Ron.
(CONTINUED)

49 CONTINUED: (3) 49
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Ron! Forward!
Snape DISSOLVES into a mad whirling mass, then mutates
into a... GIANT SPIDER. As Ron GASPS, Harry and Hermione
exchange an uncertain glance. Lupin puts his hands on
Ron's shoulders to steady him. Ron raises his wand.
RON
Riddikulus!
CRACK! ROLLER SKATES materialize on the spider's hairy
feet and it begins to shuffle crazily in place.
Instantly, Ron relaxes as the class' LAUGHTER rings out.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Parvati!
As Parvati steps up, the spider SPINS faster and faster,
a DIZZYING BLUR, then reappears as a VAMPIRE.
PARVATI
Riddikulus!
As the vampire WHIPS its cloak across its eyes, we CUT
BEHIND... so our POV is of the students. SWISH! The
cloak reopens, the class LAUGHS, and we REVERSE again...
see that the vampire is now dressed like CARMEN MIRANDA.
As it begins to SHIMMY about -- against its will -- the
class starts to CLAP.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Mr. Thomas!
As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body
attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched
SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA.
DEAN THOMAS
Riddikulus!
The cobra's hooded head BOBS back and forth, transforms
into a JACK-IN-THE-BOX. Lupin grins and...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Next!
... turns, sees Harry step forward expectantly. Concern
flickers through Lupin's face. The Jack-In-The-Box
pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry,
becoming more sinister, transforming into a...
(CONTINUED)

49 CONTINUED: (4) 49
... Dementor. Suddenly the MUSIC FADES. Harry starts to
raise his wand, then... freezes, transfixed. The
Dementor looms closer and closer, when...
... Lupin steps between, snaps his wand.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor vanishes and a ROILING MIST
appears, which becomes CLOUDS. Something glows within
the clouds, white, silvery and round...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
POP! The orb deflates like a punctured balloon, WHIZZES
crazily about the room, then darts back into the
wardrobe. The door SLAMS SHUT and the CLASS CHEERS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well done, everyone. I think
that's enough excitement for today.
As the students exit, chattering loudly, only Harry,
subdued, remains behind. At the doorway, Lupin glances
back, exchanges a private glance with him. As he exits,
the WARDROBE gives one last RATTLE.
50 EXT. CLOCK TOWER COURTYARD - MORNING (TWO WEEKS LATER) 50
A great buzzing queue of STUDENTS -- Third Years and
older -- each clutching a PERMISSION FORM -- pass by a
glowering Filch.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Remember! These visits to
Hogsmeade Village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect
poorly on the school in any way,
that privilege shall not be
extended again.
Harry approaches her, but before he can utter a syllable:
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
No permission form. No visiting
the Village. That's the rule,
Potter.
(CONTINUED)
42.
50 CONTINUED: 50
HARRY
Yes, Professor, but I thought if
you said I could go --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
But I don't say so. A parent or
guardian must sign, and since I am
neither, it would be
inappropriate.
(a flicker of pity)
I'm sorry, Potter. But that's my
final word.
Ron and Hermione -- watching Harry expectantly from
across the way -- see him turn, shake his head. Their
faces fall. Harry raises his hand in farewell. Watches
them go.
PROFESSOR LUPIN (O.S.)
So. No Hogsmeade, eh ?

Deep in the distance, some BOYS skate about on brooms,

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well, don't feel too bad. I was
roundly disappointed the first
time I went.
HARRY
Really?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
No. I was just trying to make you
feel better. Honeydukes' sweets
are the best in the world. Their
Pepper Imps are so strong you
smoke at the ears. And Zonko's
Joke Shop may be dangerous, but
you can't beat their Stink
Pellets.

55 CONTINUED: 55
HARRY
(nodding glumly)
Not to mention The Shrieking
Shack, which, according to
Hermione, is the most severely
haunted building in Britain.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Yes, that too...
HARRY
Professor, can I ask you
something?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You'd like to know why I stopped
you from facing the Boggart.
(off Harry's surprise)
I should think it'd be obvious. I
assumed the Boggart would take the
shape of Lord Voldemort.
Harry frowns. Lupin studies him curiously.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
But clearly... I was wrong.
HARRY
I did think of Voldemort first.
But then, I remembered that night
on the train... and the
Dementors...
(CONTINUED)
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well, well. I'm impressed. That
suggests that what you fear most
of all is... fear. Very wise.
HARRY
Before I fainted... I heard
something. A woman. Screaming.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors force us to relive the
worst memories of our lives. Our
pain becomes their power.
HARRY
I think it was my mother. The
night she was murdered.
Harry looks up. Finds Lupin studying him.
(CONTINUED)
44.
55 CONTINUED: (2) 55
PROFESSOR LUPIN
The first time I saw you, Harry, I
recognized you immediately. Not
by your scar. By your eyes.
They're your mother Lily's.
(nodding)
Yes. I knew her. She was there
for me at a time when no one else
was. We used to talk for hours.
She was not only a singularly
gifted witch but an uncommonly
kind woman. She had a way of
seeing the beauty in whoever she
met, even -- and perhaps most
especially -- when that person
couldn't see it in themselves...
Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Which perhaps explains her
affection for your father. James
had, shall we say, a certain
talent for trouble. A gift, rumor
has it, he passed on to you.
Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smiles
vaguely.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I could tell you stories -- and
there are many about your parents,
Harry -- but know this...
(eyeing Harry intensely)
They lived. Every moment of every
day. You should know that.
That's how they'd want to be
remembered.
56 INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING (LATER) 56
The Hall buzzes with tales of Hogsmeade, as students swap
stories, sample sweets, and send SOAP BUBBLES of all
shapes, sizes and colors into the air. A MARIONETTE of a
HARLEQUIN cavorts atop the Gryffindor table, moving its
limbs in response to the STRANDS of LIGHT that extend
from Neville's fingertips. Seamus passes his hand
through the light beams and -- FLUMPH! -- the Harlequin
collapses.

RON
And Honeyduke's is brilliant!
Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees --
and blood-flavored lollipops for
Halloween!
Harry nods, picking quietly through the spray of
brilliantly colored sweets on the table. Hermione
notices.
HERMIONE
But, I mean, after awhile, it got
a bit boring. Don't you think,
Ron?
RON
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing.
Hang on. I almost forgot. I got
you something wicked at Dervish
and Banges. It's a Pocket
Sneakoscope.
Ron places a SMALL GLASS SPINNING TOP on the table.
RON
If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's meant to light up
and spin. Mind you, Fred and
George say it's rubbish, sold for
wizard tourists, but I thought,
you know, it can't
hurt, given that...
HARRY
Sirius Black's trying to kill me.
Harry looks up, GRINS at the two of them.
HARRY
I'm glad you had a good time.
Really. And thanks for this.
(eyeing the Sneakoscope)
Rubbish or not, you're right. It
can't hurt.
With that, Harry pops a PEPPER IMP into his mouth.

Let me through, please. Excuse

Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen.
GINNY
The Fat Lady... she's gone.
RON
Probably stuffing her face with
the apples in that still life on
the second floor again.
GINNY
No. You don't understand --
Hermione GASPS. GRABS Harry's arm. He looks. SEES:
The Fat Lady's portrait has been SLASHED VICIOUSLY, great
strips of canvas hanging from the frame. Just then,
Dumbledore appears.
DUMBLEDORE

Tell them to search every painting
in the castle for the Fat Lady.

FILCH
There'll be no need for
ghosts, Professor...
Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near the
ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own,
trembling.
DUMBLEDORE
Dear lady. Who did this to you?
FAT LADY

Eyes like the devil he's got. And
a soul as dark as his name. It
was him, Headmaster. The one they
talk about. He's here. Somewhere

Nor anywhere else in the castle.
DUMBLEDORE
(nodding)
I didn't really expect him to
linger.
SNAPE
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts castle on one's
own, completely undetected...
Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the
bait.
SNAPE
You may recall, prior to the start
of term, I did express my concerns
when you appointed Professor --
DUMBLEDORE
I do not believe a single
professor inside this castle
would have helped Sirius
Black enter it, Severus.
As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out over
the slumbering students.
DUMBLEDORE
No... I feel quite confident the
castle is safe. And I'm more than
willing to let the students return
to their Houses. But tomorrow.
For now, let them sleep...

feigns sleep.

SIR CADOGAN
Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan!

balls it up in his hands. As he opens them, a MOTH
flutters from his palms.
HARRY
Excuse me, sir, but... where's
Professor Lupin?
SNAPE
That's not really your concern, is
it, Potter? Suffice it to say,
your Professor finds himself
incapable of teaching at the
present time. Page 394.
Snape waves the MOTH away, blows out a candle and a SLIDE
SHOW BEGINS. An ANCIENT WOODCUT of a HORRIFIC BEAST
flickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at
his book.
RON
Werewolves?
HERMIONE
But, sir, we've only just begun
learning about Red Caps and
Hinkypunks. We're not meant to
start nocturnal beasts for
weeks --
SNAPE
Quiet!
RON
(to Harry)
When did she come in? Did you see
her come in...
SNAPE
Now. Which of you can tell me the
difference between an Animagus and
a werewolf?
As the class stares mutely at a SLIDE of an ATTACKING
WEREWOLF, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to
respond to Snape's question, the moth flutters by Harry.

mushrooms into the air and Harry lifts his palm.
Malfoy's PARCHMENT has reappeared.
SNAPE
No one? How... disappointing.
HERMIONE
Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn
into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter.
Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
responds only to the call of its own kind --
Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.
SNAPE
Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must
admit to feeling your pain. That
is the second time you have spoken
out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell
me. Are you incapable of
restraining yourself? Or do you
take pride in being an
insufferable know-it-all?
RON
(to Harry)
He's got a point, you know.
Harry stares at the parchment. Malfoy has drawn a crude
caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING over and over.
SNAPE
Five points from Gryffindor!
(to the class)
As a antidote to your ignorance, I
prescribe two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf by Monday morning,
with particular emphasis placed on
recognizing it.
(suddenly)
Passing notes, Potter?
Snape SNATCHES the drawing from under Harry's nose. Eyes
it.
SNAPE
Not exactly Picasso, are you? I
hope you demonstrate more talent
on the Quidditch pitch this
weekend then you do as an artist.

STREAKING BLURS from his vantage. KA-SSSST! A STITCH OF
LIGHTNING strikes the TAIL of ANGELINA JOHNSON'S broom.
As it BURSTS into FLAMES, she PLUMMETS to the pitch. Ron
looks down at his own HAND. In the HIGHLY-CHARGED AIR,
the HAIR above his knuckles RISES.
In the sky, Harry flies fearlessly, searching for the
Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and
CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF VIEW far below. Suddenly, in
the stands opposite, a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand
of a RAVENCLAW GIRL. For a moment, it sails wondrously
through the heavy air, a Magritte dream, then -- WHOOP!
WHOOP! WHOOP! -- abruptly picks up speed, ROTATING LIKE
A HATCHET. Harry DUCKS, turns, and watches it disappear
into a bank of clouds. Then...
... something GLIMMERS: the Snitch. Instantly, Harry
jets off closing fast on the tiny, glimmering ball,
chasing it through one cloud... then another... and
another... until...
... he BREAKS into a clear patch of sky... only to find
the Snitch is gone. Angrily, Harry whips the Nimbus back
around, searching the horizon frantically, when he spies
something:
In the stadium's HIGHEST TOWER, something ENORMOUS
flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE, then is obscured by a
veil of mist.
Harry turns. In the distance, the stray umbrella spins
INTO VIEW, harpoons a player. Harry's eyes shift. The
SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of
a cloud. Harry begins to go... when the veil of mist
shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief
moment -- a GREAT DOG is revealed. As this mist closes,
Harry frowns, jets away.
As Harry pelts after the Snitch, the crowd RISES TO THEIR
FEET, ROARING. Ron GRINS over the binoculars, watching
Harry shred the mist as he urges his broom on.
HARRY
Faster!
Come on!
The trace of a smile forms on Harry's lips as he closes
on the Snitch... only yards away... reaching out...
when...
(CONTINUED)

68 CONTINUED: (2) 68
... a THIN GLAZE of ICE clouds his GLASSES. He wipes at
them, then flinches: BLOOD trickles down his cheek. The
rain is turning to needles. Needles of ice. Harry
glances at the HANDLE of his BROOMSTICK. The water
sluicing through the grain is FREEZING. VAPOR streams
from his mouth and nose.
SWOOSH! A dark SILHOUETTE passes on his right. He
turns. SWOOSH! -- a twin SILHOUETTE passes on his left.
Harry sees neither. Looks down. The layers of mist are
parting below. LIGHTNING STRIKES. Reveals: an ARMY OF
SILHOUETTES drifting onto the pitch. A vast legion of
them...
DEMENTORS.
A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND, rises in pitch,
not a whistle at all, but a... SCREAM. A WOMAN'S SCREAM.
Harry's eyes flutter, and wisps of SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
float from his mouth. His glasses glaze over completely.
His fingers, rigid, can no longer grip the broom and...
He FALLS.
HERMIONE
No!!!
Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions.
The Nimbus soars end over end, tossed by the currents,
then drops... right into the Whomping Willow.
FLOOMPH! Harry, in freefall, drops through one cloud,
then another. Plummeting through the circling Dementors.
Then... a TALL FIGURE rises from the crowd. Raises an
OPEN HAND to the heavens. Eyes angry but clear.
Dumbledore.
An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the
air.
A FLASH -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky.
And then...
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
Not a sound. For the longest time. Then... VOICES:
RON
Looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
(CONTINUED)
55.
68 CONTINUED: (3) 68
FRED
Peaky? What d'you expect him to
look like? He fell fifty feet.
GEORGE
Yeah, c'mon, Ron. We'll walk you
off the Astronomy Tower and see
how you come out looking.
HARRY
Probably a right sight better than
he normally does.
Harry opens his eyes and Ron, Fred, George, and Hermione
SLOWLY COME INTO FOCUS, standing at the foot of his bed
in the hospital wing.
HERMIONE
Harry! How're you feeling?
69 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 69
As Harry edges up against his pillow, we see a NURSE in
the b.g., removing the SPOKES of an umbrella from a
Hufflepuff player's neck. Harry doesn't look so good
himself.
HARRY
Brilliant.
FRED
Gave us a right good scare, mate.
HARRY
What happened?
RON
You fell off your broom.
HARRY
Really? I meant the match. Who
won?
Silence. Uncomfortable glances.
HERMIONE
No one blames you, Harry. The
Dementors aren't meant to come on
the grounds. Dumbledore was
furious. After he saved you, he
sent them straight off.
(CONTINUED)
56.
69 CONTINUED: 69
Harry nods grimly, stares at the RAIN LASHING the window.
RON
There's something else you should
know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when
it blew away? -- it sort of landed
in the Whomping Willow. And well...
He tips a BAG of SPLINTERED WOOD and TWISTED TWIGS onto
the bed. As Harry stares, we hear a gentle WIND, then...
PROFESSOR LUPIN (V.O.)
I'm sorry about your broom, Harry.
There's no chance of fixing it?
70 EXT. BLACK LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON 70
Harry shakes his head in response to Lupin's question,
then -- WHOOSH! -- sets Hedwig free of her traces. As
she soars into the sky, Harry and Lupin watch from the
lake's edge.
HARRY
Why do they affect me so,
Professor? I mean, more than
everyone else...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors are among the foulest
creatures that walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory, until a person
is left with nothing but his worst
experiences. You're not weak,
Harry. The Dementors affect you
most, because there are true
horrors in your past. Horrors
your classmates can scarcely
imagine. You have nothing to be
ashamed of.
HARRY
I'm scared, Professor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I'd consider you a fool if you
weren't.
(CONTINUED)
57.
70 CONTINUED: 70
HARRY
I need to learn how to fight them.
You could teach me, Professor.
You made that Dementor on the
train go away...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
There was only one that night...
HARRY
But you made it go away.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
(a beat)
I don't pretend to be an expert,
Harry. But yes, I can teach you.
Perhaps after the holiday. For
now, though, I need to rest. I'm
feeling... tired.
Harry turns, studies Lupin's haggard face. A weary smile
appears as Hedwig's reflection glides over Lupin's
irises.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Beautiful...
Harry looks up, watches Hedwig pinwheel through the blue,
past the CLOCK TOWER and EXIT FRAME. CAMERA HOLDS, the
skies PALES, and SNOW begins to fall. We TILT DOWN...
70A EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY (WEEKS LATER) 70A
... to Hogwarts castle, weeks later, dusted in white.
71 EXT./INT. CLOCK TOWER - DAY 71
Harry, framed in the window, stares out, looking forlorn.
In REFLECTION, SNOW falls on the glass.
HARRY’S POV
A ragged line of students follows McGonagall toward the
bridge. Harry's POV becomes OBJECTIVE and...
72 EXT. C LOCK TOWER COURTYARD - DAY 72
... FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow, moving quickly to join
the other students.
(CONTINUED)
58.
72 CONTINUED: 72
Suddenly, Fred and George appear, heading the opposite
way and... the FOOTPRINTS reverse themselves... as if
Fred and George were escorting an invisible person.
FRED
Clever, Harry.
GEORGE
But not clever enough.
FRED
Besides, we've got a better way.
73 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 73
The great doors open and Fred and George enter. The
INVISIBILITY CLOAK drops and Harry is revealed, looking
cross. Instantly, Fred slaps a WORN ROLL OF PARCHMENT
into his hand. Harry unfurls it. Frowns. It's blank.
HARRY
What's this rubbish?
FRED
Rubbish he says. That there's the
secret to our success.
GEORGE
It's a wrench giving it to you,
believe me.
FRED
But we've decided your need's
greater than ours. George, if you
will...
GEORGE
I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.
George touches his wand to the parchment and INTRICATE
INK LINES surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like
veins. Harry reads the CURIOUS WORDS at the top:
HARRY
'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs are proud to present
The Marauder's Map'...?
GEORGE
Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and
Prongs. We owe them so much.

HARRY
Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And
that... No. Is that really...
Harry points to a small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore."
FRED
Dumbledore.
GEORGE
In his study.
FRED
Pacing.
GEORGE
Does that a lot.
HARRY
You mean, this map shows...
FRED
Everyone.
HARRY
Everyone?
GEORGE
Everyone.
FRED
Where they are.
GEORGE
What they're doing.
FRED
Every minute.
GEORGE
Of every day.
HARRY
Brilliant! Where'd you get it?
FRED
Nicked it from Filch's office, of
course, first year. Now listen.
There's seven secret passageways
out of the castle. But we'd
recommend...

HARRY
The One-Eyed...
FRED
Witch, right. But you best hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
(as they go)
Oh. And, Harry? When you're
done, make sure to give it a tap
and say, 'Mischief managed.'
Otherwise, anyone can read it.
74 INT. DIVINATION STAIRWELL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 74
Harry approaches a STATUE of a hump-backed, ONE-EYED
WITCH.
INSERT MAP -- Harry traces his finger along the tattered
surface to an INK FIGURE labeled "Harry Potter." A tiny
SPEECH BUBBLE appears: "Dissendium."
HARRY
Dissendium?
CLICK! The witch's EYE OPENS and the statue pivots,
revealing a DARK OPENING in the floor. As Harry
crouches, squinting, a cool DRAFT OF AIR ruffles his hair
and the CAMERA DRIFTS INTO the DARKNESS...
75 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - DAY (LATER) 75
A tiny LIGHT bobs in the distance, fracturing the
darkness, then Harry appears, the tip of his wand
GLOWING, map in hand. INSERT MAP: "Harry Potter" glides
across the parchment.
NEW ANGLE - DAY (LATER)
Harry stops, cranes his neck. STONE STEPS. Taps the map.
HARRY
Mischief managed.

76 INT. HONEYDUKE’S SWEETSHOP - CELLAR - SAME TIME - DAY 76
CRATES. HUGE ROLLING BINS. A WOOD STAIRCASE. A
trapdoor lifts. Harry's eyes appear. As he pulls
himself up, a DOOR BANGS OPEN. Dense CHATTER ROARS from
above. Quickly, Harry hides, watches a MAN'S BOOTS
descend the stairs. Then...
WOMAN (O.S.)
A box of Jelly Slugs as well,
Horace. We're nearly cleared out.
HORACE grunts, begins moving boxes. Harry looks up to
the cellar door, takes out the invisibility cloak...
77 INT. HONEYDUKE’S SWEETSHOP - SAME TIME - DAY 77
The CELLAR DOOR EASES open -- but no one appears. We
TRACK THROUGH a sweet tooth's dream, SWARMING with
customers. Up ahead, Neville prepares to lick the
LOLLIPOP in his hand, when it simply floats from his
fingers and out the door...
78 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - CONTINUOUS 78
ACTION - DAY
... into the MISTY, FOG-SHROUDED chaos of Main Street.
As the lollipop drifts on, FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow
below...
79 EXT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DAY (LATER) 79
At this elevation, the MIST hangs in thick, undulating
veils, the Shrieking Shack an eerie silhouette in the
gloom. Ron and Hermione stand stiffly, attempting, as
best they can, to conceal the fact that, basically,
they're scared stiff.
HERMIONE
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I
mention that?
RON
Twice.
HERMIONE
Should we move a bit closer?
RON
Huh? Oh... All right...
(CONTINUED)
62.
79 CONTINUED: 79
They take a step. One step. Stop dead.
RON
Actually, it's fine from here.
HERMIONE
Perfect.
Just then, VOICES ECHO and THREE FIGURES appear over the
rise, phantoms in the mist. Malfoy. Crabbe. Goyle.
Pike.
DRACO
Well, well. Look who's here. You
two shopping for your dream home?
Seems a bit grand for you, WeaselBee.
Don't your family all sleep
in one room?
RON
Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
DRACO
(clucking his tongue)
Now that's not very friendly.
Boys, I think we're going to have
to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his
superiors.
HERMIONE
(a harsh chuckle)
Hope you don't mean yourself.
Malfoy's eyes shift, regard Hermione with disgust.
DRACO
How dare you speak to me, you
filthy, little mud --
SPLAT! Malfoy takes a SNOWBALL to the grill. Splutters:
DRACO
Who did that!
Malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- SPLAT!
SPLAT! -- he takes two more. Hermione and Ron glance
about uneasily.
DRACO
Well, don't just stand there!
(CONTINUED)
63.
79 CONTINUED: (2) 7 9
Crabbe and Goyle start for Ron and Hermione, when --
FLUMPH! -- their knees go out and they fall headfirst
into the snow. Draco begins to back away fearfully,
eying the mist...
DRACO
Wait a minute, there's something
out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!
Malfoy's SKI MASK is pulled over his eyes, he's spun
about, given a ROUGH KICK to the ass and sent stumbling
over the rise and out of sight. Instantly, Crabbe and
Goyle join him.
Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance,
and... DASH OFF... when -- FLUMPH! -- they both go
flying, land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up,
they hear...
LAUGHTER. Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion.
HERMIONE
Harry?
Harry...?
The Invisibility Cloak drops. Sure enough. Harry.
Grinning.
RON
That was not
Bloody hell, Harry!
funny!
But he's smiling. They all are. As he and Hermione pelt
Harry with SNOWBALLS, we --
CUT TO:
80 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - DAY (MOMENTS 80
LATER)
The trio trudge through the SWIRLING SNOW. Harry's
donned Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat to disguise
himself.
RON
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map!
HERMIONE
But Harry isn't going to keep it.
He's going to turn it over to
Professor McGonagall, aren't you?
(CONTINUED)

80 CONTINUED: 80
RON
Oh sure. Along with his
invisibility cloak, his pack of
exploding snap cards, his --
HERMIONE
Oh, shut up.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
Rosmerta, m'dear!
Up ahead Cornelius Fudge emerges from a MINISTRY SLEIGH
as Hagrid swings the door clear and -- with unfortunate
ease -- rips it clean off the fittings. Fudge joins
McGonagall and a CURVY BARMAID (ROSMERTA) outside the
THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB.
HERMIONE
That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron
fancies her.
RON
It's not true!
HARRY
Shhh.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
I trust business is good?
MADAM ROSMERTA
It'd be a right sight better if
the Ministry wasn't sending
Dementors into my pub every other
night.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Sirius Black? In Hogsmeade! And
what would bring him here?
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Harry Potter.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Harry Potter!

Fudge looks around nervously, then jerks his head toward
the pub. As he leads Rosmerta and McGonagall inside,
we --
CUT BACK TO:
HERMIONE AND RON
RON
Harry?
He's gone. FOOTPRINTS track through the snow, into the pub.
81 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - HARRY’S POV FROM UNDER THE 81
INVISIBILITY CLOAK - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
... as he THREADS THROUGH the teeming pub, PAST a SIGN
("No Underage Wizards") and nearly collides with some
very STRANGE-LOOKING PATRONS. Ron and Hermione ripple
briefly past a frosted window, then... THREE SHRUNKEN
HEADS swing INTO VIEW.
SHRUNKEN HEAD #1
So I says to him, 'Careful, Ned.
Don't want to go losing your head!'
As the three heads CACKLE HYSTERICALLY, bobbing up and
down on their strings, Harry turns... just as an UNSHAVEN
WIZARD'S arm whips down and a DART goes WHISTLING right
toward Harry's eyes. Harry DUCKS, pivots, and -- THWOCK!
-- sees the dart pierce the cork of the disfigured
DARTBOARD behind him.
Harry hurries on, trailing Fudge and McGonagall up a DARK
STAIRWELL as Rosmerta leads them into a small BACK ROOM.
As the door starts to close, Harry rushes forward: SLAM!
Too late. CAMERA TILTS. The KNOB turns, the door
opens...
82 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - CARD ROOM - DAY 82
... and SNOW flutters off the sill of a HALF-OPEN WINDOW.
McGonagall turns, frowning, and re-closes the door,
harder this time, then joins Fudge and Rosmerta. HARRY'S
POV SHIFTS FROM one TO the other as they speak.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Come on then. Let's hear it.
(CONTINUED)
66.
82 CONTINUED: 82
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Years ago, when Harry Potter's
parents were marked for death,
they went into hiding. Few knew
where they were. One who did was
black. And he told...
MADAM ROSMERTA
You-Know-Who. I've heard this
rot. It was all over The Daily
Prophet back in the day. And I'll
say now what I said then: Of all
the boys I ran out of here,
Black's the last who would've gone
over to the dark side. Hearsay.
That's all the Ministry had.
Hearsay.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!
MADAM ROSMERTA
Peter Pettigrew?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Little lump of a boy? Always
tagging after Black and...
MADAM ROSMERTA
I remember him. What's he got to
do with it?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
After the Potters were killed,
Pettigrew went looking for Black.
And, unfortunately... found him.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Black was vicious. He didn't kill
Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A
finger. That's all that was left.
A finger -- there's your hearsay.
Rosmerta looks to McGonagall. She nods grimly.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sirius Black may not have put his
hands to the Potters, but he's the
reason they're dead. And now he
wants to finish what he started.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Harry.
(CONTINUED)
67.
82 CONTINUED: (2) 82
McGonagall nods, then looks pained.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
But that's not the worst of it.
MADAM ROSMERTA
What could be worse?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
This: Sirius Black was and
remains today... Harry Potter's
godfather.
BLAM! The pub doors fly open, REVEAL Main Street, where
Ron and Hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the
chill. As they look down, CAMERA TILTS...
83 EXT. MAIN STRE ET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - MOMENTS LATER - 83
DAY
... and FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow. HARRY'S POV ENDS.
CAMERA TILTS UP, FOLLOWS Hermione and Ron until they
LEAVE FRAME, then HOLDS ON a POSTER of BLACK, fluttering
against a lamppost: "Have you seen this wizard?"
84 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 84
At the end of a ROCKY OUTCROP, the FOOTPRINTS end and
SOBS are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm, discouraging
her from going further, but she does, filling the
footprints with her own, then kneeling and -- very gently
-- drawing the cloak from Harry. He stares into the
mist, eyes stinging with tears.
HARRY
He was their friend. And he
betrayed them. He was their
friend.
(eyes hardening)
I hope he finds me. But when he
does, I'm going to be ready. When
he does, I'm going to kill him.
85 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (TRANSITION TO SPRING) 85
Butterflies flutter over the great green lawn. The GIANT
SQUID breaks through the last GLAZE of ICE on the Black
Lake. The Whomping Willow shakes the water from its
branches...
68.
86 INT. ASTRONOMY ROOM - DUSK 86
The DYING SUN streams through high windows, painting
Harry's face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposite
Lupin. ANCIENT CHARTS drape the walls while gleaming
SPHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently. Lupin
paces before a LARGE TRUNK.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic. Well
beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.
HARRY
If Black can fight the Dementors,
I need to know how too.
Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. The spell I'm going to
teach you is called the Patronus
Charm. Ever hear of it?
Harry shakes his head.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Patronus is a kind of positive
force. For the wizard who can
conjure one, the Patronus works
something like a shield. The
Dementor feeds on it instead of
him.
Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eyes
wander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attention
back.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
But in order for it to work, you
must think of a memory. And not
just any. This memory needs to be
a very happy one. And powerful.
Harry thinks a bit. Then... nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Got something? Good. Let it fill
you up. Lose yourself in it.
Then speak the incantation:
Expecto Patronum. Without your
wand...
HARRY
Expecto Patronum...
(CONTINUED)
69.
86 CONTINUED: 86
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Right then. Shall we?
Harry nods, raises his wand. Lupin, watching closely,
reaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Concentrate, Harry.
Concentrate...
As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES. In
the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly
horrific.
HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...
The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL BREEZE fills
the chamber. A SCREAM ECHOES distantly. Harry's hand
trembles. His eyes begin to roll up...
HARRY
Expecto... Expecto...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into the
packing case. Harry stands blinking. Dazed. Lupin
fishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket. Presses it into
Harry's trembling hand.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quickly.
Harry studies the frog. Takes a bite. Begins to
recover.
HARRY
That's one nasty Dementor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Boggart, Harry. The real thing
would be much, much worse. Just
out of interest, what were you
thinking of? What memory did you
choose?
(CONTINUED)

86 CONTINUED: (2) 86
HARRY
The first time I rode a broom.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's not good enough, Harry.
Not nearly.
Harry glances toward the window, at the bloody sun.
HARRY
There's another. It's not happy
exactly. I mean, it is. It's the
happiest I've ever felt. But
it's... complicated.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Is it strong?
Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes. Emotional. Nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Then let's try it.
Harry takes a breath. Tosses the frog aside. Poises
himself.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Think, Harry, think --
HARRY
Just do it!
Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens the
packing case. Instantly, the Dementor appears again. A
chill fills the air. The hair skates off Harry's scar.
He sets his jaw...
HARRY
Expecto Patronum!
Harry's hand TREMBLES. His whole BODY TREMBLES. But he
holds his ground, when -- WHOOSH! -- a huge SILVER SHADOW
BURSTS from the end of his wand, hovering between him and
the Dementor. The Dementor falters... Harry's legs like
water...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
CRACK! The Dementor vanishes. Harry's arm drops.
Slack. Lupin eyes Harry with a kind of awe. His voice
barely a WHISPER.
(CONTINUED)
71.
86 CONTINUED: (3) 86
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well done.
HARRY
I think I've had enough. For
today.
Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
So you know, Harry: You'd have
given your father a run for his
money. And, believe me, that's
saying something.
Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself.
HARRY
I was thinking of him. And Mum.
Seeing their faces. They're just
talking to me. Just... talking.
That was the memory I chose. I
don't even know if it's real...
Harry grips the door, pushes past.
HARRY
But it's the best I have.
87 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT 87
All the boys asleep.
All except Harry, who lies in bed, studying the photo of
his parents, barely visible in the fluttering light of a
guttering candle. As the FLAME DIES with a soft HISS,
all goes BLACK and we --
CUT TO:
88 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT (LATER) 88
A hulking, haunted goliath against the sky.
89 EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT 89
A cautious breeze rises. Leaves scud across the gravel.
90 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 90
A church. Empty. Silent.

91 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 91
A WINDOWPANE RATTLES, up high, the corridor thatched in

FORWARD. A SHADOW ENGULFS Sir Cadogan, dozing against
his tree...
92 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 92
A WHISTLE SHRIEKS. The Sneakoscope, whirling madly,
skitters across the bedside cabinet and -- CLICK! CLICK!
CLICK! -- taps against a WATER GLASS, sending shafts of
RED LIGHT pinwheeling over the photo of Harry's
parents...
RON
Aaaahhhh!
Harry BOLTS UP, sees a SILHOUETTE etched on the window --
a MAN CLUTCHING A KNIFE. All the boys are up now.
Screaming. Amid the chaos, Harry grabs his wand.
HARRY
Everybody out!
The others flee. Harry faces the HULKING SHADOW, wand
poised.
HARRY
Show yourself.
Crash! The water GLASS SHATTERS on the floor and
Scabbers darts past Harry's bare feet, chased by
Crookshanks. Seizing the moment, the SILHOUETTE grasps
the curtains and swings through the open window, plunging
into the night. Harry rushes to the window, looks down.
92A EXT. GRYFFINDOR TOWER - CONTINUOUS ACTI ON - NIGHT 92A
The SILHOUETTE leaps from ledge to ledge with an animal's
grace, then... vanishes.
92B INT. TOWER DORMITORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 92B
Harry sweeps Ron's curtains aside. His bed is... empty.
HARRY

Harry's eyes flash toward the window, when... Ron pokes
his head out from under the bed.
RON
Is he gone?
73.
93 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 93
The entire Gryffindor House, in pajamas, stand before
McGonagall, who wears a TARTAN ROBE and an expression of
singular irritation.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
That's preposterous, Weasley. How
could Sirius Black possibly have
got through the portrait hole?
RON
I don't know how he got in! I was
a bit busy dodging his knife!
Just then, a curiously content Crookshanks wends his way
through Ron's legs.
RON
And this bloody cat ate my rat!
HERMIONE
That's a lie!
RON
It is not and you bloody well know it!
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Silence!
McGonagall turns then and everyone follows her eye to Sir
Cadogan who, sensing the attention, perks up instantly.
DUMBLEDORE
Sir Cadogan. Is it possible that
you let a mysterious man enter
Gryffindor Tower tonight?
SIR CADOGAN
Certainly, good lady! He had the
password. Had the whole week's,
in fact. On a little piece of
paper.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Which abysmally foolish person
wrote down the passwords and then
proceeded to lose them!
Every eye shifts once more: Neville. McGonagall sighs.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Is it always going to be you,
Longbottom?
(CONTINUED)

93 CONTINUED: 93
NEVILLE
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
(to the group at large)
While we know Sirius Black is gone
tonight, I think you can safely
assume he will, at some future
time, attempt to return. Let me
be clear. You are not to move
about the castle alone. And you
are not to write down the
password! Understood!
A collective nod of the head. McGonagall gives the ties
of her robe a sharp tug, collects herself, and exits.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Very well then. Go to bed.
As the students drift off, Ron casts a last angry glance
toward Hermione, who now holds Crookshanks in her arms.
HARRY
I could've killed him.
Hermione turns, sees Harry staring out the window.
HARRY
He was right there. Close enough to touch.
I could've killed him.

96A EXT. SLOPE - DAY 96A
The trio make their way down the slope.
RON
I find it astonishing that someone
who prides herself on being so
logical can be in such denial.
HERMIONE
Harry. Will you explain to your
friend Ronald that he has
absolutely no proof whatsoever
that my sweet, unassuming cat ate
his shabby, decidedly decrepit
rat.
(CONTINUED)
75.
96A CONTINUED: 96A
RON
Harry was there! He'll tell you
how it was. Go on, Harry, tell
her.
HARRY
No, I won't. Know why? Because I
don't care about your stupid rat!
I don't care about your stupid
cat! I've got few other things on
my mind right now!
RON
Really? Wasn't you had to roll
under the bed last night to avoid
getting cut to ribbons! A person
could die being your friend,
Harry!
Ron stops, wishes he could take it back. They all wish
he could. Avoiding each other's eyes, they turn,
continue on.
97 EXT. BLACK LAKE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 97
Hagrid, wearing a GIGANTIC, HAIRY BROWN SUIT and perhaps
the world's ugliest YELLOW AND ORANGE TIE, stands knee
deep in the shallows of the Black Lake, skimming rocks as
big as flagstones across the water's shiny gloss. As he
turns, the trio catches a brief sight of his eyes, red
with tears, then he looks away.
HERMIONE
How'd it go, Hagrid?
HAGRID
Buckbeak liked London.
HERMIONE
I meant the hearing.
HAGRID
Oh. That. Well, I got up an'
said my bit -- You know, how
Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an'
as long as yeh treated 'im with
respect, he'd treat you the same.
Then Lucius Malfoy got up an' said
his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak
was a deadly dangerous beast that
no teacher in their righ' mind
would expose their students to...
(CONTINUED)
76.
97 CONTINUED: 97
HERMIONE
(dreading it)
And...?
Hagrid slings another rock into water.
HERMIONE
You mustn't blame yourself,
Hagrid.
RON
Draco. It's him the Committee
should punish. It's him they
should send off to the forest, not
Buckbeak.
HAGRID
Buckbeak's not going back to the
forest...
HERMIONE
(dreading the answer)
Where's he going, Hagrid?
HAGRID
He asked fer the worse, yeh see,
Lucius Malfoy did. An' the
Committee granted it. Buckbeak's
bin sentenced ter death.
98 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT 98
Dark. Ominous. Dementors drift in the distance.
Restless...
99 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT 99
Silent. A room of shadows. While those around him
slumber, Harry lies awake, unable to sleep. Finally, he
turns to his cupboard, takes the Marauder's Map.
WHISPERS:
HARRY
I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.
The crooked corridors and serpentine passageways of
Hogwarts radiate across the parchment, then... a TINY DOT
catches Harry's eye. He frowns. It reads: "Peter
Pettigrew."
77.
100 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 100
Harry moves down a DARK corridor, map in hand, WAND
AGLOW. In the PAINTINGS he passes, the subjects SNORE
SOFTLY.
INSERT - MARAUDER’S MAP
"Harry Potter" and "Peter Pettigrew" draw closer and
closer.
BACK TO SCENE
Harry squints toward the end of the corridor. Down at
the map. Pettigrew moves quickly down the adjoining
corridor. Twenty yards away. Ten. Only seconds away...
Wand trembling in his hand, Harry glances from the map to
the dark corridor ahead, again and again. Then... as the
two DOTS are about to collide... he looks slowly up...
turns the corner... heart in his chest... and meets...
HIMSELF
... reflected in a MIRROR. He BLINKS, startled, then
glances back down at the map. Pettigrew has moved past
him. Confused, Harry wheels, casts his wand along the
walls.
VOICE (O.S.)
Watch it there, boy!
Harry JUMPS. But it's only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING,
scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. On the map,
"Pettigrew" continues to move away. Harry makes to
follow, then stops. HEARS FOOTSTEPS. The WAND'S SPOT
dances across the parchment, finds another DOT.
Approaching FAST: "Severus Snape."
HARRY
Mischief managed!
Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and
turns... into the harsh glare of Snape's wand.
SNAPE
Potter. What're you doing
wandering the corridors at night?
HARRY
I was... I was... sleepwalking...
A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips.
(CONTINUED)
78.
100 CONTINUED: 100
SNAPE
How extraordinarily like your
father you are, Potter. He, too,
was exceedingly arrogant.
Strutting about the castle --
HARRY
My dad didn't strut. Nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
appreciate you lowering your wand.
Snape eyes Harry coldly. Containing himself. Lowers his
wand.
SNAPE
Turn out your pockets.
Harry doesn't move, eyes still boring into Snape.
SNAPE
Turn out your pockets!
Finally, Harry obliges. Seeing the map, Snape's eyes
glitter.
SNAPE
And this. What might it be?
HARRY
Spare bit of parchment...
SNAPE
Really...
(poising his wand)
Reveal your secret!
To Harry's horror, words begin to appear. Snape studies
him, a sadistic half-smile on his lips. Turns the map
his way.
SNAPE
Read it.
HARRY
'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and...'
SNAPE
Go on.
(CONTINUED)
79.
100 CONTINUED: (2) 100
HARRY
'... and request that he keep his
abnormally large nose out of other
people's business.'
SNAPE
(smile drooping)
Why you insolent little --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Professor...?
Snape turns. Sees Lupin standing in the shadows.
SNAPE
Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little
walk in the moonlight, are we?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry? You all right?
SNAPE
That remains to be seen. I've
just now confiscated a rather
curious artifact from Mr. Potter.
Take a look, Lupin. This is
supposed to be your area of
expertise.
Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather
unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions.
SNAPE
Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I seriously doubt that, Severus.
It looks to me as if it merely
insults anyone who tries to read
it. I suspect it's a Zonko
product. Nevertheless, I shall
pursue any hidden qualities it may
possess. As you say, it's my area
of expertise. Come, Harry.
101 INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN’S OFFICE - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) 101
Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map
fiercely.
(CONTINUED)
80.
101 CONTINUED: 101
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I don't know how this map came to
be in your possession, Harry, but
I'm astounded that you didn't turn
it in. Did you ever stop to think
that this -- in the hands of
Sirius Black -- is a map to you?
Harry walks silently. Lupin can barely contain his anger.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father didn't set much store
by rules either. But he and your
mother did give their lives to
save yours. Gambling their
sacrifice by walking about the
castle unprotected, with a killer
on the loose, strikes me as a poor
way to repay them. I won't cover
up for you again, Harry.
Lupin enters his office, tosses the map on his desk, and
begins to sort through some papers. Harry lingers
briefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOON
that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn
away. Stops.
HARRY
Professor. Just so you know, I
don't think the map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the
castle. Someone I know to be dead.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
(only half-listening)
And who was that, Harry?
HARRY
Peter Pettigrew.
Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his
papers.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. I'd like you to return
to your dormitory now. Oh, and
Harry? Don't take any detours.
As Harry looks back, Lupin taps the map.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
If you do. I'll know.

CLOSEUP - CRYSTAL BALL
murky with smoke.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY (V.O.)
Relax... Let your mind... go...
102 INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING 102
The students gaze into CRYSTAL BALLS, faces reflecting
the mist within, so that their very skin seems to be made
of smoke.
Conspicuously, Harry, Ron and Hermione sit apart.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Crystal-gazing requires that you
clear the Inner Eye. Only then,
will you... See. Oh my, what do
we have here...?
As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her
eyes.
HERMIONE
Here we go again. It's the Grim!
It's the Grim!
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
(eyes narrowing)
My dear, from the moment you first
arrived in my class, I sensed that
you did not possess the proper
spirit for the noble art of
Divination. You may be young in
years, but the heart that beats
beneath your bosom is as shriveled
as an old maid's, your soul as dry
as the pages of the books to which
you so desperately cleave.
Stung, Hermione starts to reply, but -- remarkably --
seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly,
she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry
watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the
doorway...
LAVENDER
'In late spring, one of our number
will leave us forever!' You knew,
Professor! You saw.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
On these occasions, I take no joy
in my gift, Miss Brown.
82.
102A EXT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING (LATER) 102A
As the students exit, Ron, walking separately from Harry,
turns to Neville.
RON
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean, not that she wasn't always
mental, but now it's out in the
open for everyone to see...
Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry
watches him go, along with the others, then spies
Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing.
102B INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 102B
Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts
to go, when... the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly
DARKENS. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that
appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then,
a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and...
... a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder. He wheels,
finds...
HARRY
Professor Trelawney --
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
He will return tonight....
Harry stiffens. Trelawney's voice is eerily HOLLOW.
HARRY
S-sorry?
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Tonight, when the clock strikes
twelve, the servant shall break
free. He and his Master shall be
reunited. It cannot be prevented.
Trelawney smiles savagely... then her head falls forward.
When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon
Harry's shoulder. Her hand.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
So sorry, dear boy. Did you say
something?
Her voice is normal once more. Harry shakes his head.
HARRY
No. Nothing.
83.
103 INT. DIVINATION STAIRWELL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 103
Harry -- clearly unsettled by his encounter with
Trelawney -- hastens down the stairs, and we...
FADE OUT.
104 INT. C LOCKTOWER COURTYARD - DAY (LATER) 104
SWOOK! SWOOK! We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as
it glides to the flock circling the feet of a POT-BELLIED
MAN (THE EXECUTIONER) sitting in the courtyard. As he
sharpens his AXE -- SWOOK! SWOOK! -- we --
CUT TO:
HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE
hurrying past. The Executioner looks up and we --
CUT TO:
105 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 105
... Harry, leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut.
HERMIONE
I can't believe they're going to
kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.
HARRY
It just got worse.
She and Ron look and SEE:
106 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - LATE 106
AFTERNOON
Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a
grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand,
spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch,
tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Hagrid wipes his eyes,
lopes into the hut.
DRACO
Did you see the big, fat
blubbering oaf?! Oh, this is
going to be rich. Did I tell you,
Father said I can keep the head --
(looking up)
Ah. Come to see the show?
(CONTINUED)
84.
106 CONTINUED: 106
HERMIONE
You... foul... loathsome...
evil... little cockroach...
Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear
as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose,
when...
RON
Hermione! No!
She turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. He looks away.
RON
He's not worth it.
Hermione nods, then -- SMACK! -- quick as lightning,
lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat
on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs,
Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind.
HERMIONE
That felt good.
107 EXT. SLOPE/PUMPKIN PATCH - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 107
LATER)
The trio makes their way down the slope and past
Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction.
108 INT. HAGRID’S HUT - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK) 108
Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and
Ron sit. Hermione makes tea.
HAGRID
Look at 'em. Loves the smell
o' the trees when the wind
blows...
HARRY
I say we set him free.
HAGRID
(shaking his head)
They'd know I did it. And tha'
would only get Dumbledore in
trouble. Gonna come down, yeh
know. Says he wants ter be with
me when it... when it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
(CONTINUED)
85.
108 CONTINUED: 108
HERMIONE
We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
HAGRID
Yeh will not! Think I wan' yeh
seein' a thing like this! No.
Yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off.
But before yeh do -- I wan' ter
see you an' Ron shake hands,
Harry.
Ron and Harry exchange a glance, then look to Hagrid.
HAGRID
Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin
betw'n you two? Go on now...
Reluctantly, Harry and Ron extend their hands. Shake.
HAGRID
Good. Now then. Ron, I wan' ter
see you give Hermione a hug.
HERMIONE/RON
What!
HAGRID
Go on! You two've been at it all
year. An' I'm sick o' it.
Acutely uncomfortable, Hermione and Ron step forward and
perform perhaps the most awkward hug Hogwarts has ever
seen.
HAGRID
Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most
pathetic hug I e'er seen. But yeh
did it, an' tha's wha' matters.
There's jus' one other thing...
RON
I'm not kissing Fang if that's
what you're thinking...
Hearing his name, FANG -- Hagrid's giant boarhound --
THUMPS his tail happily on the floor. Hagrid turns,
takes the lid from a FLOUR TIN, A TINY HEAD, ears flecked
with powder, emerges.
RON
Scabbers! You're alive!
(CONTINUED)
86.
108 CONTINUED: (2) 108
HAGRID
Yeh should keep a closer eye on
yer pets, Ron.
HERMIONE
I think you owe someone an
apology.
RON
Right. Next time I see
Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
HERMIONE
I meant me.
HAGRID
Crikey. Here we go agin...
SMASH! A GLASS JAR on the SHELF SHATTERS. As Hermione
scoops up a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE, a second STONE
bounces off the back of Harry's head.
HARRY
Ow!
Harry turns, looks out the window.
HARRY
Hagrid...
Everyone turns. Looks. Dumbledore and Fudge approach.
Behind them, in a fluttering shroud of CROWS, the
Executioner follows, axe at his side. Hagrid begins to
panic.
HAGRID
Yeh got to go! It's almost dark.
Anyone sees yeh outside the castle
it'll be trouble! Big trouble!
'Specially you, Harry --
BANG! BANG! BANG! The door SHAKES. Hagrid stiffens in
fear. Harry reaches up, puts his finger to Hagrid's
trembling lips, speaks softly to the others.
HARRY
C'mon.
109 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT - PUMPKIN PATCH - WIDE SHOT - DUSK 109
(MOMENTS LATER)
As the trio exit through the back door, Fudge, Dumbledore
and the Executioner enter through the front.
(CONTINUED)
87.
109 CONTINUED: 109
A veil of crows flutters onto the roof. More drop into
the patch, begin to slowly circle Buckbeak.
Harry and the others duck behind the pumpkins, watch
Hagrid solemnly greet the others. Fudge appears at the
window. Picks his nose. Just then, a Shhh! is heard.
Hermione turns. The branches of the trees behind her are
DANCING ODDLY.
HARRY
What?
HERMIONE
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.
110 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 110
The trio slip silently into a stand of trees. Beyond
them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun.
High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.
DING!
DING!
DING!
The trio stops, fighting their tears. A QUARTET OF BLEAK
SHADOWS files from the hut. One of the SHADOWS --
Dumbledore -- raises his hand and points, directing the
attention of the others away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore
speaks briefly -- unintelligible from this distance,
then -- CAW! CAW! -- The crows SHRIEK excitedly and the
Executioner separates from the others, disappears behind
a LOW STAND OF TREES.
DING!
All goes very still. The wind loses its voice...
DING!
Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees,
INTO VIEW...
DING!
The ax hangs seemingly forever, etched against the sky,
then drops from sight. A SICKENING CHOP! fouls the
breeze and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb
disbelief. Hermione, face turned away, trembles...
(CONTINUED)
88.
110 CONTINUED: 110
DING!
The SUN sets, dropping behind the mountains in the
distance. Hermione turns. Sees a frenzied spray of
crows stain the bloody sky, their PRIMAL SHRIEKING rising
like a curse.
Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder and
CAMERA FALLS WITH her, CONTINUING DOWN the length of
Ron's arm to his hand, where a DROP OF BLOOD hangs from
his finger, drops like a tear...
DING!
Ron stares at his hand. At the blood running down his
finger.
RON
He bit me...
His eyes shift. See Scabbers streaking away.
HERMIONE
Ron! No!
As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give
chase.
110A EXT. RIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110A
Ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top.
Hermione and Harry follow.
110B EXT. WHOMPING WILLOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110B
Harry and Hermione reach the top of the ridge. Stop.
HERMIONE
Harry. You do realize what tree
this is...
Ron nabs Scabbers, cradles him in his bloody palm.
RON
Now behave yourself.
CAMERA PULLS BACK: Ron is kneeling under the Whomping
Willow.
(CONTINUED)
89.
110B CONTINUED: 110B
HARRY
That's not good.
(yelling)
Ron! Run!
Ron spins. Looks toward Harry.
RON
Harry! Run!
Harry's eyes shift. Bounding toward him in the gathering
gloom is an ENORMOUS, PALE-EYED, JET-BLACK... DOG. Harry
shields himself when... the dog LEAPS CLEAR OVER HIM.
RON
Aaaahhh!
The dog's TEETH flash and -- SNAP! -- close on Ron's
foot, dragging him TOWARDS THE TRUNK like a rag doll.
Instantly, Harry dashes forward, leaps out, and grabs
Ron's hands... but he and Ron just keep skudding along
the ground.
HERMIONE
I've got you --
Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the
three of them go scudding along.
RON
Harry!
Harry raises his chin. The dog vanishes into the GAP at
the base of the tree, begins to pull Ron through...
HARRY
Hold on, Ron!
But it's no use. The dog is too powerful. Harry glances
around desperately, then finds himself looking directly
in Ron's eyes. He can read his mind.
HARRY
No, Ron...
One by one, Ron releases his fingers from Harry's
forearm. Sacrificing himself.
HARRY
Nooooo!!!
But Ron closes his eyes, releases his hands fully, and...
(CONTINUED)
90.
110B CONTINUED: (2) 110B
Disappears. As his VOICE ECHOES deep into the earth...
Harry and Hermione rise, peer into the hole.
WHOMP! The Whomping Willow sweeps first Hermione, then
Harry, into the air and -- FLOOMPH -- drops them on their
backsides.
HARRY AND HERMIONE’S POV - THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD
Swaying beautifully against the dusky sky, swishing
softly.
BACK TO SCENE
As one, they rise. Run back toward the gap in the tree.
A branch swoops down.
Hermione ducks. Harry doesn't. WHOOSH -- he is flung
one way, his GLASSES the other.
Hermione HOPS over another branch -- looks briefly
pleased with herself -- only to find herself SWEPT HIGH
IN THE AIR by a second branch. She looks down, sees
Harry searching the ground for his glasses.
HERMIONE
Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
Harry squints up, sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST of a branch
screaming straight down for his head. He rolls away just
as -- WHOMP! -- the branch PULVERIZES the ground.
Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME, still clinging on for dear
life, and Harry rises. FLUMPH! -- he's promptly knocked
to the ground again. Hermione goes CRASHING through the
high branches, Harry spies his glasses and grabs them.
Rising, he fits them to his face and...
HIS BLURRY POV...
... turns CRYSTAL CLEAR just in time to see Hermione
FLYING MADLY TOWARD HIM.
HERMIONE
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
HARRY
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Hermione reaches out, grabs Harry's shirt and -- riding
the branch in tandem -- the two boomerang back, hurtling
toward the trunk of the tree, through the gap, and into
the darkness...
91.
111 INT. WILLOW ROOTS - TUNNEL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 111
... below. OOMPH! Harry hits the ground hard. OOMPH!
Hermione falls on top of him.
HERMIONE
Thanks.
HARRY
Don't mention it. Lumos.
As the tip of Harry's WAND GLOWS, reveals a long, snaking
tunnel.
HERMIONE
Where do you suppose this goes?
HARRY
I have a hunch. I just hope I'm
wrong...
111A INT. TUNNEL TO SHRIEKING SHACK - NIGHT 111A
Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive
passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead.
Then, abruptly, the tunnel... ends. Confused, Harry and
Hermione glance about, then -- as one -- peer up. A
small opening. Harry reaches up, hoists himself through.
112 INT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DECREPIT ROOM - NIGHT 112
Harry pulls Hermione up. Looks about. Paper peels from
the walls. Stains -- suspiciously similar to dried blood
-- blot the floorboards. Shattered furniture lies strewn
everywhere.
HERMIONE
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?
Harry doesn't answer, staring at the DOG PRINTS in the DUST
on the floor. The CEILING CREAKS. They dash to the stairs.
113 INT. HALLWAY - LANDING - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 113
They come out, look down. A wide, shiny stripe cuts
through the DUST-LADEN floor -- as if something has been
dragged -- to the end of the hallway, where a LIGHT seeps
from a door.
HARRY
Nox.
(CONTINUED)
92.
113 CONTINUED: 113
His wand-light dies. Slowly, they step to the door.
Exchange a look. She nods, wand ready, and Harry KICKS
the door aside.
114 INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME 114
Ron sits upon a sagging bed, clutching his bloody foot.
HERMIONE
Ron! You're okay --
HARRY
The dog -- where's the --
RON
He's the dog.
It's a trap, Harry.
He's an Animagus...
Harry looks down, follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to
a pair of FILTHY HUMAN FEET. Harry looks up slowly at
the MAN standing in the shadows. Filthy, matted hair
hangs to his shoulders. His skin like a corpse.
SIRIUS BLACK.
He studies Harry's face keenly. Harry draws his wand.
HERMIONE
If you want to kill Harry, you'll
-- you'll... have to kill us, too!
SIRIUS BLACK
No. Only one will die tonight.
HARRY
Then it'll be you!
HERMIONE
Harry! No!
Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound. Black wheels toward the
door, edgy. Harry eyes Black, wand hand shaking
violently. As Black turns back, he stops, regards Harry
cautiously.
SIRIUS BLACK
Going to kill me, Harry?
HARRY
Yes.
(CONTINUED)
93.
114 CONTINUED: 114
Harry raises his wand. BLAM! -- the DOOR CRASHES OPEN:
Lupin.
HARRY/HERMIONE/RON
Professor Lupin!
Lupin ignores them, eying Black intensely.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Looking a bit ragged, aren't we,
Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
the madness within.
SIRIUS BLACK
You'd know all about the madness
within, wouldn't you, Remus?
The two regard each other, the moment taut with tension,
then Lupin steps forward and... EMBRACES Black like a
brother.
HERMIONE
No! I trusted you! I covered up
for you. And all this time you've
been his friend!
(pointing)
He's a werewolf! That's why he's
been missing classes!
Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin. Black HOWLS
then, bitterly amused. Lupin eyes him, then turns back.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
How long have you known?
HERMIONE
Since Professor Snape set the
essay.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're the brightest witch of your
age I've ever met, Hermione.
SIRIUS BLACK
Yes, you glow like the sun. And
you howl at the moon. Enough
talk! He dies. Now. If you
won't do it with me, Remus, I'll
do it alone.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Wait, Sirius --

114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
I did my waiting! Twelve years of
it! In Azkaban! Trust me, you
wouldn't have lasted a week!
Lupin eyes Black, then nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
All right then. As you wish...
HARRY
No!
Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and, with a flick
of his own, disarms him. Furious, Harry eyes Black
murderously.
HARRY
You betrayed my parents! You sold
them to Voldemort!
SIRIUS BLACK
It's a lie! I never would've
betrayed James and Lily!
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry! You've got to listen --
HARRY
Did he listen! When my mother was
dying! Did he hear her screaming!
SIRIUS BLACK
No! I wasn't there! And I'll
regret it the rest of my life!
Harry's eyes flash to Black's, glittering with pain.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Someone else betrayed your
parents, Harry. Someone in this
room right now. Someone who,
until quite recently, I believed
to be dead.
SIRIUS BLACK
He's as good as dead.
HARRY
What're you talking about?
There's nobody here.
(CONTINUED)
95.
114 CONTINUED: (3) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
Oh yes there is...
Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a cruel sing
song:
SIRIUS BLACK
Come out, come out, Peter
Come out, come out and play...
Ron draws back from Black's demented gaze.
RON
You're mad...
Harry's eyes shift from Ron's FACE to his HANDS, where
Scabbers TWISTS violently. As a curious expression
befalls Harry, Lupin and Black, as one, raise their
wands... when.
SNAPE
Expelliarmus!
The wands fly from their hands. The others turn, find
Snape standing in the doorway, smiling smugly.
SNAPE
(eying Black)
Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I
hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Severus --
SNAPE
I told Dumbledore you were helping
your old friend into the castle.
And here's the proof.
SIRIUS BLACK
Brilliant! And -- as usual --
dead wrong. Now give us our wands
back. Remus and I have a bit of
unfinished business to tend to.
As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck.
SNAPE
Give me a reason. I beg you.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Don't be a fool, Severus!
(CONTINUED)
96.
114 CONTINUED: (4) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
He can't help it. It's habit by
now.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quiet, Sirius!
SNAPE
(clucking his tongue)
Listen to you two. Quarreling
like an old married couple. The
creature and the criminal.
SIRIUS BLACK
Piss off.
SNAPE
Witty as ever I see. Tell me,
will you be so irreverent when I
turn you over to the Dementors?
(as Black reacts)
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
One can only imagine what it must
be like to endure the Dementor's
Kiss. It's said to be unbearable
to witness. But I'll do my best.
Snape's eyes harden. He gestures to the door.
SNAPE
After you.
As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table
where Lupin has left Harry's wand. In a flash, it's in
his hand.
HARRY
Expelliarmus!
Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a THUD, and
slides down. Ron and Hermione stare in shock.
HERMIONE
You attacked a teacher.
Harry.
Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.
HARRY
You said Peter before. Peter who?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Pettigrew. He was at school with
us. We thought he was a friend.
(CONTINUED)
97.
114 CONTINUED: (5) 114
HARRY
He killed
No. Pettigrew's dead.
him.
As Harry points at Black, Black laughs mirthlessly.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I thought so, too. Until you
mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the
Map.
HARRY
The Map was lying then --
SIRIUS BLACK
The Map never lies. Pettigrew's
alive. And he's right there.
Black points at... Ron. Ron goes white with fear.
RON
M-me? It's lunatic...
SIRIUS BLACK
Not you, you idiot. Your rat.
RON
Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my
family for --
SIRIUS BLACK
(bitterly)
Twelve years. A curiously long
life for a common garden rat.
He's missing a toe, isn't he?
Black unfolds a dog-eared clipping from The Daily
Prophet: it shows Ron in Egypt with his family, Scabbers
on his shoulder.
RON
So what?
HARRY
All they could find of Pettigrew
was his --
SIRIUS BLACK
Finger. Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was
dead. Then he transformed into a
rat.
(CONTINUED)
98.
114 CONTINUED: (6) 114
Harry stares into Black's sunken eyes. Wanting to
believe. Desperate to believe. Glances at Ron, his
agonized face. Scabbers SQUIRMS VIOLENTLY.
HARRY
Show me.
Lupin and Black turn to Ron. He holds Scabbers
protectively.
RON
What are you going to do to him?
Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.
SIRIUS BLACK
Together.
With that, Lupin takes out his wand and, as one, he and
Black cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. Scabbers twists
madly in midair, then -- FLASH! -- transforms into... a
very short man with thinning hair and grubby hands.
PETER PETTIGREW.
PETTIGREW
S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old
friends.
Neither speaks. Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart
toward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes a
break for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back.
Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry. His
hands flutter nervously, reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER.
PETTIGREW
Harry! Look at you! Y-you look
just like your father. Like
James. We were the best of
friends, he and I --
SIRIUS BLACK
Shut up!
PETTIGREW
I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord,
you have no idea the weapons he
possesses! Ask yourself what you
would have done, Sirius. What
would you have done!
(CONTINUED)
99.
114 CONTINUED: (7) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
Died! Died rather than betray my
friends! And you should have
realized, Peter, if Voldemort
didn't kill you...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
We would.
PETTIGREW
No... please... you can't...
(eyes darting,
finding)
Ron! Haven't I been a good
friend? A good pet? You won't
let them kill me, will you? I was
your rat...
Ron draws back in disgust. Pettigrew turns to Hermione.
PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...
As one, Lupin and Black raise their wands, point them
directly into Pettigrew's face. He shrinks back
trembling, closing his eyes in fear, when...
HARRY
No.
Pettigrew's lids lift. Lupin and Black turn. Staggered.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry, this man...
HARRY
I know what he is. But we'll take
him to the castle.
PETTIGREW
Bless you, boy! Bless you --
HARRY
Get off! I said we'd take you to
the castle. After that, the
Dementors can have you.

117 EXT. WHOMPING WILLOW - NIGHT (LATER) 117
As Pettigrew emerges from the gap, he prattles
desperately:
PETTIGREW
Turn me into a maggot. A dung
beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything
but the Dementors...
(as Ron emerges)
Ron! Haven't I been a good
friend? A good pet? You won't
let them kill me, will you? I was
your rat...
As Ron draws back in disgust, a sleepwalking Snape BUMPS
his head against a low limb. Hermione turns to Harry.
HERMIONE
Don't worry. He's under the
Somnambulist Charm. It's
primarily used to transport the
seriously deranged.
As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.
PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...
Hermione tugs her robes from Pettigrew's sweaty grasp.
Harry turns, sees Black staring in wonder at the castle,
shining radiantly under the bright bowl of the night sky.
SIRIUS BLACK
Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never
forget the first time I walked
through those doors. It'll be
nice to do it again. Freely.
(turning to Harry)
That was a noble thing you did
back there. He doesn't deserve
it.
Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, looks away. Lost in
thought.
HARRY
I don't reckon my father'd want
his best friends to become killers
for a worthless piece of vermin
like Pettigrew. Besides: Dead,
the truth dies with him. Alive...
you're free.
(CONTINUED)
101.
117 CONTINUED: 117
Sirius studies Harry's profile, moved by this.
SIRIUS BLACK
I don't know if you know, Harry,
but when you were born, James and
Lily made me your guardian...
HARRY
I know.
SIRIUS BLACK
And, well, I'll understand if you
choose to stay with your aunt and
uncle, but, so you know, you
could --
HARRY
When!
Come live with you?
SIRIUS BLACK
Soon as my name's cleared...
Harry looks at Hogwarts. GRINS. Sirius does the same.
Then, Hermione's voice rises on the air, quavering with
fear.
HERMIONE
Harry...
He turns, see Hermione staring at the FULL MOON. His
eyes shift. Lupin is a rigid silhouette, his fingers
twitching.
SIRIUS BLACK
Remus, old friend... did you take
your potion tonight?
Lupin, twitching, SHAKES HIS HEAD. Pettigrew's eyes
dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift, note
the WAND trembling in LUPIN'S LENGTHENING FIST.
SIRIUS BLACK
Run. All of you. Now.
But none of them do, transfixed, watching as BRISTLES
POKE THROUGH LUPIN'S SKIN. Black steps forward, wraps
his arms around his friend, presses his mouth to his ear.
SIRIUS BLACK
You know the man you truly are,
Remus. This flesh is only flesh.

SIRIUS BLACK (CONT'Dpounding Lupin's
chest)
This heart is where you truly
live. This heart! Here!
As Lupin's WAND DROPS... Pettigrew LEAPS.
HARRY
No!
(flashing his wand)
Expelliarmus!
Lupin's wand flies from Pettigrew's hand and he FREEZES.
Then slowly turns. Face blank, eyes closed, he... GRINS
HIDEOUSLY. Transforms. Stunned, Harry watches a RAT
dart into the night.
A HOWL PIERCES THE AIR and Harry wheels. With a shrug,
Lupin tosses Black into the air, then turns. He is no
longer human. He's a werewolf. Harry and Hermione begin
to edge back.
HERMIONE
Professor...?
The WEREWOLF'S eyes blaze. Long teeth glitter. Then...
a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat. Harry and
Hermione spin, begin to flee... and run flat into Snape.
As they collapse in a great clumsy pile, Snape's eyes
flutter open, the spell broken. Seeing Hermione atop
him, he sweeps her aside...
SNAPE
Out of the way!
... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
to his feet, Snape draws his wand and steps forward,
shielding Hermione, Harry and Ron.
The WEREWOLF HOWLS, SPRINTS forward, when -- SWOOSH! -- a
GIANT DOG (Black) intercepts it in MIDAIR. They hit the
ground in a FIERCE TANGLE of FLASHING TEETH, a single
horrible flailing beast. Again and again, the dog pushes
the werewolf back, but the werewolf is too strong...
HARRY
Sirius!
The DOG YELPS, ROARS in pain, and the werewolf flings it
into the tall grass. As it charges after, Harry pushes
past Snape, dashes into the night. Hermione makes to
follow, but Snape holds her back.
(CONTINUED)
103.
117 CONTINUED: (3) 117
HERMIONE
Harry!
Harry runs full out. Up ahead, FRAMED AGAINST A FULL
MOON, he spies the dog, lying inert, the werewolf's
razor-sharp claws suspended over its neck.
HARRY
NO!!!
Desperately, Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground
and hurls it with all his might. Bull's-eye. The
werewolf freezes. Turns. Begins to move toward...
Harry.
Harry draws his wand, terrified, but tormented as well,
knowing Lupin dwells somewhere within the beast.
HARRY
Please, Professor. Stop... It's
me.
Suddenly... a HOWL pierces the night.
The werewolf falters, cocking its head toward the forest.
Harry waits, petrified. The WEREWOLF's eyes shift back
to him. It SNARLS, moves closer, ready to kill. Harry
covers his face with his arm, when...
... a SECOND HOWL ECHOES high above the forest. Slowly,
Harry drops his arm. Looks. The werewolf bounds toward
the forest, vanishes. Harry's eyes shift. In the
darkness, the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass.
Falls. Rises. Falls again. Each time becoming more
human. As he disappears over the ridge, Harry sprints
after.
117A EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 117A
Harry stumbles down to Black, who lies on the water's
edge, now fully a man, arms and face gleaming with
lacerations.
HARRY
Sirius!
Harry looks into his glassy eyes.
HARRY
Sirius!
(CONTINUED)
104.
117A CONTINUED: 117A
A fragile MIST escapes Harry's mouth. A raw WIND TOSSES
his hair. CHILL-BUMPS pebble his SKIN. A FRINGE of ICE
appears at the lake's edge. Then they appear, oozing
like smoke through the TREES across the lake. Dementors.
HARRY
No... No!
(drawing his wand)
Expecto... Patronum!
A thin silvery wisp weeps from Harry's wand, hovering
like a VEIL, but the Dementors continue to come. Harry
places his hand on Black's HEAVING HEART, poises his wand
once more:
HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...
Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies. Harry's
eyes flutter, the DEMENTORS twisting madly in his vision,
drawing closer. Black GASPS. SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT
tumble from his lips, as if his very soul were leaving
him...
Then... a LIGHT splinters the trees. Harry squints, sees
a FIERY STAG appear... its body luminous... slashing
through the trees... sowing light in the darkness. The
Dementors wilt in its wake, but more replace them,
sweeping down in waves. Still, the stag charges on. The
LIGHT EXPANDS. The forest blazing with it. The remaining
Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash.
The light ebbs. The stag's luminous body flickers.
There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single
THREAD of LIGHT all that remains, spinning down to the
size of a PEARL... in the palm of MAN, standing deep in
the trees. Harry studies the strangely familiar
SILHOUETTE, then... it is gone.
Silence drops like a curtain. MIST rises from the lake.
As Snape appears at the top of the rise, we --
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
118 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT (LATER) 118
CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... out of HERMIONE'S SHADOW,
which ripples against the curtain that encircles Harry's
bed. A HAND reaches out -- Harry's hand -- and sweeps
the CURTAIN ASIDE. Ron lies opposite, his leg BANDAGED.
Hermione paces. Stops.
(CONTINUED)

118 CONTINUED: 118
HERMIONE
Harry --
HARRY
I saw my dad.
HERMIONE
What...?
HARRY
He sent the Dementors away... I
saw him. Across the lake...
Hermione exchanges a private glance with Ron, turns back.
HERMIONE
Listen, Harry. They've captured
Sirius. Any minute the Dementors
are going to perform the Kiss.
HARRY
The Kiss...?
HERMIONE
It's what Dementors do to those
they want to destroy. They clamp
their jaws over the victim's mouth
and... suck out his soul.
HARRY
You mean, they're going to kill
Sirius?
HERMIONE
No. It's worse. Much worse. You
go on living. But you have no
memory. No sense of self. You're
just a shall. An empty shell...
As Harry reacts, the door opens and Dumbledore enters.
HERMIONE
Headmaster! You've got to stop
them! They've got the wrong man!
HARRY
It's true, sir. Sirius is
innocent --
RON
It's Scabbers who did it!

DUMBLEDORE
Scabbers...?
RON
My rat, sir. Only he's not really
Well, he was a rat. You

Percy's --
HERMIONE
The point is... we know the truth.
Please, sir, you must believe us.
DUMBLEDORE
I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry
to say the word of three thirteenyear-old
wizards will convince few
others. A child's voice, however
honest and true, is meaningless to
those who have forgotten how to
listen.
As Dumbledore turns to the window, a SHOOTING STAR
plummets silently through the sky.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah... a shooting star. If ever
one was to make a wish, now would
be the time. But time, I'm
afraid, is precisely our
problem...
On cue, the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME... DING!...
DING!
DUMBLEDORE
Mysterious thing, time. Powerful.
And, when meddled with...
dangerous. Sirius Black is in the
topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
(to Hermione)
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen. And you
would, I feel, do well to return
before this last chime. If not...
well, the consequences are really
too ghastly to discuss. Three
turns should do it, I think. If
you succeed, more than one
innocent life may be spared
tonight.

118 CONTINUED: (3) 118
Dumbledore hands Harry and Hermione each a stick of
CHOCOLATE, then starts to go... stops.
DUMBLEDORE
By the way, when in doubt, I find
retracing my steps to be a wise
place to begin... Good luck.
He smiles, exits. Harry glances curiously at the
chocolate.
RON
What in bloody hell was all that
about?
But Hermione doesn't reply, instead looping the pendant's
long chain around Harry's neck as well as her own.
HERMIONE
Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you
can't walk...
As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the BELL
continues to CHIME -- DING! DING! -- and...
119 INT. HOSPITAL WING - TIME REVERSAL - NIGHT/LATE 119
AFTERNOON
TIME REVERSES in a dizzying backward blur, as if a tape
were being rewound, every moment that occurred in the
hospital room flickering by at a dizzying speed while,
outside the window, darkness gives way to dusk and the
sun "un-sets," returning to its place low on the horizon.
At this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is...
Empty. Except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione
unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion.
HARRY
What just happened? Where's Ron?
Hermione ignores the question, eyes the CLOCK on the
wall.
HERMIONE
Seven-thirty. Where were we at
seven-thirty?
HARRY
Huh? Dunno... going to Hagrid's?

Harry and Hermione come to a mad, huffing halt.
HARRY
Hermione! Will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?!
She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry
follows her gaze and BLINKS in DISBELIEF. Across the
grounds...
124 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON 124
... he sees himself, along with Hermione and Ron, about
to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths.
HARRY
But that... that's... us. This is
not... normal.
INTERCUT BETWEEN BRIDGE AND SUNDIAL GARDEN.
Dumbfounded, Harry turns. Hermione holds up the HOURGLASS.
HERMIONE
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first
term. This is how I've been
getting to my lessons all year.
HARRY
You mean, we've gone back in time?
HERMIONE
Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to
return to this moment. Clearly
something happened he wants us to
change.

A soft SMACK is HEARD. They turn, see Malfoy land on
the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rub his
kisser.
HARRY
(in admiration)
Good punch.
HERMIONE
Hurry! Malfoy's coming!
Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later,
FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads.
DRACO (O.S.)
Not a word of this to anyone,
understood! I'll get that jumped
up Mudblood one of these days.
Mark my words...
Eyes narrowed in anger, Hermione leans out, reaches up,
and sends Malfoy SPRAWLING. As Harry pulls her back,
Malfoy looks around in confusion, then dashes off with
the others.
Seconds later, Harry emerges, marvels at the sight
of himself and Hermione, and Ron heading down the
slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin
patch.
HARRY
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
HERMIONE
Of course! Remember what
Dumbledore said. If we succeed,
more than one innocent life could
be spared.
HARRY
Buckbeak? But... how will saving
Buckbeak help Sirius?
HERMIONE
We'll see.
125 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT - PUMPKIN PATCH - LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK 125
As Buckbeak feasts on a ferret, Harry and Hermione duck
behind a pile of pumpkins. Peering into the hut, Harry
sees Hermione and Ron embrace awkwardly.
(CONTINUED)

125 CONTINUED: 125
He grins, turns, only to find Hermione analyzing the
moment with considerable fascination. Caught -- regards
Harry defensively.
HERMIONE
What?
HARRY
Nothing.
Harry looks toward the slope, sees Fudge and the others
approaching in a CLOUD of CROWS.
HARRY
Here they come. I better hurry.
HERMIONE
No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him. Otherwise,
he'll think Hagrid set him free!
Harry nods, then looks toward the hut. Inside, Hagrid is
handing Scabbers to Ron.
HARRY
That's Pettigrew --
As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him, speaks
fiercely.
HERMIONE
No, Harry! You can't!
HARRY
Hermione, that's the man who
betrayed my parents! You don't
expect me to just sit here...
HERMIONE
Yes! You Must!
(pointing inside)
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut
right now. If you go bursting
inside, you'll think you've gone
mad. Awful things can happen when
wizards meddle with time. We
can't be seen.
Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing
closer. She frowns, glances into the hut.
(CONTINUED)
111.
125 CONTINUED: (2) 125
HERMIONE
Fudge is coming and... we're not
leaving... why aren't we leaving?
Just then... on the ground beside her... Hermione notices
a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE. Instantly, she grabs it,
rises, and hurls it through the OPEN WINDOW. SMASH! The
sound of a GLASS JAR SHATTERING is heard within the hut.
HARRY
Are you mad?
Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone
through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of
Harry's head.
HARRY
That hurt.
HERMIONE
Sorry.
Crows begin to drop atop the roof. Fudge's party
arrives, RAPS on the door.
HERMIONE
C'mon. Any minute now we're going
to be coming out the back door.
Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly
behind... just in time to see themselves -- along with
Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin
pile where, only seconds before, they were hiding. As
Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before,
Hermione ponders the back of her own head.
HERMIONE
Is that really what my hair looks
like from the back?
HARRY
Shhh!
Hermione sees herself turn. Ducking, she accidentally
stirs the branches, then peeks out and sees herself
staring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY. Next
she hears her own voice:
HERMIONE (O.S.)
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.

125 CONTINUED: (3) 125
Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope.
The coast clear, they slip out of the trees.
HERMIONE
Now, Harry!
As Harry vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at
his ankles, pecking at his feet.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'It is the decision of the
Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures that the
Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter
called the condemned, shall be
executed this day at sundown...'
As Harry approaches, Buckbeak studies him curiously, a
ferret leg dangling from his beak. Harry bows. SLURP!
The ferret leg disappears and Buckbeak returns Harry's
nod. As Harry takes Buckbeak's chain... a flint-eyed
crow PECKS his hand.
HARRY
Get away!
Harry waves the crow away, yanks hard on Buckbeat's
chain.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'The Committee's appointed
executioner shall dispatch the
condemned by means of
beheading...'
HARRY
C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on...
Buckbeak refuses to move.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'As witnessed below.' You sign
here, Hagrid. Very well,
gentlemen. Let's step outside,
shall we...
DING! The Hogwarts BELL begins to TOLL. Harry and
Hermione exchange a glance. Harry tugs harder. No go.
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
Excuse me, Minister. I believe I
must sign as well...

dead ferret before Buckbeak.
HERMIONE
Here, Beaky... Come and get the
nice dead ferret... yum yum...
Harry looks at her as if she's mad, but it's... working.
As Buckbeak trots after, the CAWING CROWS scatter.
DING!
Harry and Hermione lead Buckbeak away when the back door
suddenly opens. They freeze... caught... Fudge's eyes
drifting their way, when -- as before -- Dumbledore
raises his hand and directs the attention of the others
away from Buckbeak.
DUMBLEDORE
Professor Dippet had those
blackberries planted when he was
Headmaster...
Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into
the forest... just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Let's get this over with, shall
we?
Harry and Hermione -- their view unobstructed by the LOW
STAND OF TREES this time -- watch the Executioner
approach the pumpkin patch... and stop. Quickly, the
confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
But... where is it? I just saw
the beast not moments ago --
Hagrid?
HAGRID
Beaky...
Hearing Hagrid's husky voice, BUCKBEAK strains at his
tether, WHIMPERS eerily. Hermione tosses him another
ferret.
DUMBLEDORE
(a hint of amusement)
How extraordinary!

125 CONTINUED: (5) 125
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's
obviously released him.
HAGRID
Professor, I swear! I didn't!
DUMBLEDORE
I'm quite sure the Minister isn't
suggesting that you had anything
to do with it, Hagrid. How could
you? You've been with us all
along.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We should search the grounds --
DUMBLEDORE
Search the skies if you must,
Minister. In the meantime, I
wouldn't say no to a cup of tea,
Hagrid. Or... a large brandy.
(to the Executioner)
It seems your services will no
longer be required.
The Executioner lifts his blade and -- with a brutal fury
-- plunges it into the flesh of a PUMPKIN with a
SICKENING CHOP!
The CROWS SCATTER to the skies.
126 EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 126
Harry and Hermione race through the trees as Buckbeak
lopes easily behind.
HARRY
Now what?
HERMIONE
We save Sirius.
HARRY
And we do that... how?
HERMIONE
No idea.
127 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - DUSK 127
SUBJECTIVE POV, GLIDING THROUGH a thicket of trees, TO
the forest's edge, the trees thinning, REVEALING...
115.
127A EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - DUSK 127A
... the Whomping Willow THRASHING. Hermione disappears
down the hole, then a FIGURE approaches the tree. Lupin.
INTERCUT.
HERMIONE
Look. It's Lupin.
As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence
oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick, pokes
a knot on the trunk. Instantly, the Willow calms.
HARRY
Wait until Fred and George hear
about that one.
HERMIONE
Here comes Snape.
As Lupin disappears into the gap at the base of the tree,
Snape makes his way down the slope.
HARRY
And now we wait.
HERMIONE
Now we wait.
127B EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - DUSK TO NIGHT 127B
(LATER)
We look UPWARD, see the tops of the trees etched against
the darkening sky. BATS fly TOWARD us. We FOLLOW one,
when Buckbeak snags one. A tail twitches briefly between
his beak, then -- SLURP! -- is gone.
HERMIONE
'Least someone's enjoying himself.
Harry and Hermione sit together in the lengthening
shadows. Harry snaps off a piece of chocolate, hands it
to Hermione.
HARRY
Hermione...
HERMIONE
Yes?
(CONTINUED)
116.
127B CONTINUED: 127B
HARRY
Before. Down by the lake. When I
was with Sirius... I did see
someone... that someone made the
Dementors go away...
HERMIONE
With a Patronus. I heard Snape
telling Dumbledore when we were
taken to the hospital. According
to him, only a really powerful
wizard could have conjured it.
HARRY
It was my Dad.
Hermione looks at Harry.
HARRY
It was my Dad who conjured the
Patronus.
HERMIONE
But, Harry, your Dad's...
HARRY
Dead. I know. I'm just telling
you what I saw.
Hermione nods, not wanting to press Harry further, then
glances beyond the trees, toward the Whomping Willow.
HERMIONE
Here we come.
128 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - NIGHT 128
SHADOWS emerge under a FULL MOON: Black. Harry.
Pettigrew. Lupin. Hermione. Ron. Sleepwalking
Snape...
INTERCUT:
Harry studies himself and Sirius.
HARRY
You see Sirius talking to me?
He's asking me to come live with
him.
HERMIONE
Really?
(CONTINUED)
117.
128 CONTINUED: 128
Harry nods, his voice wistful.
HARRY
When we free him, I'll never have
to go back to the Dursley's. I'm
going to tell him I'd like to live
someplace in the country. I think
he'd like that, after all those
years in Azkaban. We don't need a
big place and I can help him...
A HOWL pierces the night. Hermione glances toward the
Willow.
HERMIONE
It's happened. Lupin's
transformed.
HARRY
Which means Pettigrew is slipping
safely into the night. While we
just stand here...
A FIERCE GROWLING is heard as twin silhouettes -- the DOG
and the WEREWOLF -- bound into the tall grass. Harry
watches himself appear, hurl the stick as before. The
werewolf turns, begins to stalk...
OWWWWWWWWW! Harry wheels, sees Hermione, hands cupped to
her mouth, making a loud HOWL. He covers her mouth.
HARRY
What are you doing?
HERMIONE
Saving your life.
Harry looks back to the tall grass. The werewolf is
frozen. As before, it begins to approach Harry again.
OWWWWWWWW! This time, Harry doesn't stop her.
HARRY
Thanks. But we have to move.
HERMIONE
Why?
HARRY
Because that werewolf you just
called is running right this way.
They exchange a glance and... RUN.

130A EXT. FOREST - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
130A
Harry and Hermione dash for the lives, swing behind a
HUGE TREE. As CAMERA BEGINS TO CIRCLE, the werewolf
appears. Pauses. As it approaches the tree, Harry and
Hermione silently sidestep in the opposite direction,
until the werewolf... disappears. CAMERA CONTINUES TO
CIRCLE the tree...
HERMIONE
Buckbeak. We've got to find him.
... and REVEALS the werewolf, fifteen feet past, waiting.
As Harry and Hermione step out, they freeze. The
werewolf poises itself, preparing to pounce, when...
SKREEEK! The TREES shake with the fury of a HURRICANE
and Buckbeak charges into the clearing, screening Harry
and Hermione. The WEREWOLF SNARLS ANGRILY, makes to
charge. With lightning-fast reflexes, Buckbeak's claws
slash the air... only inches from the werewolf's face.
The werewolf stops, eyes glittering with rage, then...
HOWLS. Turning, it vanishes into the forest.
HERMIONE
Poor Professor Lupin is having a
really tough night...
Just then, a CHILL WIND rises...
The LEAVES of the trees TREMBLE...
EERIE SHADOWS flutter over the moon, greasy as smoke...
Dementors.
HARRY
Let's go.
CUT TO:
MOVING POV
Looking UPWARD... THROUGH the trees as the sky wheels by,
Dementors streaking IN AND OUT OF VIEW.
130B EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT BLACK LAKE - NIGHT (MOMENTS
130B
LATER)
CAMERA RUSHES IN, HOLDS ON Harry and Hermione's faces.
(CONTINUED)
119.
130B CONTINUED: 130B
Shocked.
Terror-stricken.
Opposite them, across the lake...
130C EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME 130C
... a CYCLONE of DEMENTORS whirl madly above Harry and
Black.
INTERCUT BETWEEN BLACK LAKE AND EDGE OF FOREST.
Harry watches himself vainly attempt to conjure a
Patronus as the cyclone only continues to grow...
HERMIONE
This is horrible...
HARRY
Don't worry. My Dad will come...
Right there... you'll see... he'll
come... any minute... he'll
conjure the Patronus
Hermione eyes Harry warily. He is transfixed, staring
hungrily toward the outcrop. The WIND RISES. The Lake
begins to freeze. WHOOSH! WHOOSH! One after another,
Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone...
HERMIONE
No one's coming, Harry...
HARRY
HE WILL! He will come!
She looks. Nothing. Desperately, her eyes flash to the
cyclone, to the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the
water's edge... wracked with pain... dying...
HERMIONE
No one's coming! You're dying,
both of you... and no one's
coming!
Harry's face changes. A riddle unravels. He draws his
wand.
HERMIONE
HARRY, NO!
(CONTINUED)
120.
130C CONTINUED: 130C
Too late. Harry slashes through the trees, down to the
rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father
appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of
Dementors on the other side of the lake.
HARRY
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a MIST,
then BLOOMS MAGNIFICENTLY. The trees EXPLODE WITH LIGHT.
The Lake BLAZES with reflected FIRE. Harry stands
utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the
lake, the Dementors retreat. Harry waits, still as a
statue, until each and every one is gone.
Then he simply lets his arm drop.
131 EXT. HOGWARTS - SKY - FLYING - NIGHT (L ATER) 131
WHOOSH! Harry and Hermione plunge INTO FRAME astride
Buckbeak, SOARING toward the castle. Outside the
grounds, the Dementors wait restlessly. Up ahead, Fudge
and Snape enter the Dark Tower, TORCHES in hand.
HARRY
You were right, Hermione. It
wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It
was... me. I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before. I knew I
could do it this time, because...
because I'd already done it. Does
that make sense?
Hermione contemplates this.
HERMIONE
No.
(looking down
in fear)
But I don't like this!
132 EXT. HOGWARTS - DARK TOWER - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT (MOMENTS 132
LATER)
We see Buckbeak land.
CUT TO:
133 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT 133
Sirius paces within a SMALL CELL, a man condemned.
Spying Harry and Hermione, he stops. Stunned to see
them.
121.
134 INT. DARK TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 134
Snape, TORCH in hand, leads the way as Fudge HUFFS after.
135 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 135
Hermione pushes past Harry.
HERMIONE
Out of the way!
(raising her wand)
Alohomora!
Sirius tests the IRON DOOR. Still locked.
HERMIONE
Didn't really expect that to work.
136 EXT. DARK TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 136
Snape and Fudge draw closer...
137 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 137
Wand flashing, Hermione tries spell after spell.
HERMIONE
Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare!
Emancipare!
No. No. No. No.
SIRIUS BLACK
You might try --
HERMIONE
Quiet! I'm trying to think.
She resumes pacing, MUTTERING furiously. Then... stops.
Turns.
HERMIONE
BOMBARDA!
KA-BOOM! The CELL DOOR ROCKETS to the sky.
SIRIUS BLACK
That'll do.
138 EXT. SKY/HOGWARTS - HELICOPTER SHOT - NIGHT 138
We see Buckbeak spirit Harry, Hermione and Sirius off the
terrace and soar directly TOWARD us... Just as Snape and
Fudge reach the top of the Tower.
122.
139 EXT. BUCKBEAK - FLYING - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 139
Sirius laughs, hair blowing in the wind.
SIRIUS BLACK
You truly are your father's son,
Harry!
140 EXT. CLOCKTOWER COURTYARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 140
Black puts his hands to Hermione's waist, swings her off
Buckbeak and onto the ground next to Harry.
SIRIUS BLACK
I'll be forever grateful for this.
To both of you.
HARRY
I want to go with you.
SIRIUS BLACK
One day perhaps. For some time...
life will be too... unpredictable.
Besides, you're meant to be here.
Black claps his shoulder, looks him in the eye.
SIRIUS BLACK
But promise me something, Harry.
HARRY
Anything.
SIRIUS BLACK
Trust yourself. No matter the
challenges you face -- and I fear
they will be many -- you'll be
surprised how many times you can
find the answers...
(tapping his heart)
...here.
As Sirius climbs atop Buckbeak, a SHOOTING STAR arcs
through the heavens.
SIRIUS BLACK
A shooting star. Make a wish.
WHACK! -- Black gives Buckbeak a SLAP and they soar into
the glittering sky. Harry and Hermione stand watching,
when... DING! They wheel. Look to the Clock Tower.
HERMIONE
We have to go.
(CONTINUED)

... the corridor. The Clock Tower BELL THUNDERS. The
DOOR OPENS. Dumbledore backs out...
DUMBLEDORE
By the way, when in doubt, I
always find retracing my steps to
be a wise place to begin... Good
luck.
As Dumbledore begins to close the door, Harry and
Hermione stumble frantically forward, the door about to
hit the jamb, when... suddenly... Dumbledore stops.
Looks up.
DUMBLEDORE
Well?
HARRY
He's free -- Sirius. We... we did
it.
DUMBLEDORE
Did what?
With a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the
door. As Harry and Hermione enter.
145 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT ( SAME TIME) 145
... they catch the faintest glimpse of... themselves...
across the room... just as they EVAPORATE. Ron blinks.
Turns. Frowns.
RON
How'd you two get over there? I
was just talking to you... over
there.
(CONTINUED)
124.
145 CONTINUED: 145
Ron glances to the other side of the room. Frowns.
Hermione glances mischievously to Harry.
HERMIONE
What d'you think, Harry? Too much
for him -- everything that's
happened tonight?
HARRY
Afraid so. Always been a bit of
the nervous type, Ron has.
Ron stares at them, confounded. Slowly, they... GRIN.
146 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING 146
The Whomping Willow sways in a light breeze. The Black
Lake shimmers, clouds drifting in its glassy mirror.
147 INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN’S OFFICE - MORNING 147
Harry walks softly toward an OPEN DOOR -- Lupin's
office -- and peers in. Lupin stands over a battered
suitcase, filling it with the last of his books. Without
turning, he SPEAKS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Hello, Harry.
Harry JUMPS. Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Saw you coming.
The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk.
Harry nods, looks back to Lupin. Unable to disguise his
shock at Lupin's appearance.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I've looked worse, believe me.
Harry eyes the open desk drawers... the bare
bookshelves...
HARRY
You've been sacked.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Resigned, actually.
(CONTINUED)
125.
147 CONTINUED: 147
HARRY
Resigned! But why!
PROFESSOR LUPIN
It seems that someone has let slip
the nature of my condition.
HARRY
Snape.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Whoever. It was bound to get out.
This time tomorrow, the owls will
start arriving. Parents will not
want a -- someone like me --
teaching their children.
HARRY
But Dumbledore --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Has already risked enough on my
behalf. Besides, people like me,
well... let's just say I'm used to
this by now. But before I go,
tell me about your Patrons.
HARRY
Well. At first I thought it was a
horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I
think it was --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A stag.
HARRY
Yes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father used to transform into
one. That's how he was able to
keep me company when I became...
sick. He was a great friend
James.
Lupin smiles wanly, lifts his sorry suitcase. Then
stops.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
There are stories about him and your mother, you know.
Some are even true. But I think it's safe to say, in the
end, you'll know them best by getting to know yourself.
Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand.
(CONTINUED)
126.
147 CONTINUED: (2) 147
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Mischief managed.
Harry watches the Map go blank. Looks back. Lupin is
gone.
148 OMITTED 148
149 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 149
Ron stands amid a circle of excited Gryffindors.
RON
Stand back, I said! I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle!
As Harry arrives, he glances at Hermione, who CLEARS HER
THROAT LOUDLY. The others turn, begin all speaking at
once.
NEVILLE
Harry! Wherever did you get it!
SEAMUS
Can I have a go, Harry? After
you, of course --
RON
Quiet!
(as they oblige)
Thank you. Let the man through.
Mystified, Harry steps forward, the boys peeling away,
clearing his view of the BROOMSTICK in Ron's hands. The
LABEL GLEAMS: "FIREBOLT."
HARRY
Whose is that?
RON
(as everyone laughs)
Whose is it? It's yours, mate.
HARRY
Who?
But... how?
HERMIONE
It's a mystery. Though... this
fell out of the wrapping.
Harry turns, sees Hermione holding up a FEATHER.
(CONTINUED)

150 INT./EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FRONT DOORS - DAY

BOOM! The huge vertical DOORS BURST OPEN and Harry,
trailed by the others, exits with the Firebolt. As he
strides off, others join the assembly -- Hagrid, Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle among them -- curious to see what the
commotion is all about.
151 EXT. COURTYARD - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
151
As Harry stops, an expectant HUSH hangs over the moment.
SEAMUS
Go on, Harry.
NEVILL E
Yeah. Let's see.
Harry mounts the broom. Licks his finger and jabs it in
the air. A few others do the same. Hagrid does the
same. Crabbe and Goyle start to do the same, when Malfoy
SLAPS their hands down. Finally, Harry places his hand
on the broom. Sets his grip. Takes a breath. And...
Frowns.
FRED/GEORGE
What's wrong?
HARRY
I don't think it works. I think
it's defective.
A collective GROAN. Dejected, many of the kids begin to
drift toward the castle. Harry calls after.
HARRY
Oh, come on now. It's just a
broom.
HAGRID
(nodding sagely)
Just a broom.
(CONTINUED)

151 CONTINUED: 151
Harry's eye shifts to Ron and Hermione. A wink.
HARRY
The fastest broom in the world.
As everyone turns -- WHOOSH! -- Harry JETS OFF and we --
CUT TO:
152 EXT. HIGH IN THE SKY - DAY (SAME TIME) 152
A tiny DOT, GROWING LARGER AND LARGER, races upward.
It's Harry shooting straight into the blue on the
Firebolt. A SCREAM GROWS LOUDER as he approaches. A
scream of release, of utter abandon. It's Harry
screaming. But something else is clear as he JETS PAST
and...
The SCREEN GOES BLACK.
It's a SCREAM of joy.
FADE OUT.
THE END

CHAPTER 5



I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
Come on, guys, time to go home.
Come on, love, off you get.
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?
Hey, Big D.
Beat up another
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
"Don't kill Cedric."
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."
Where is your mum?
Where is your mum, Potter?
She dead?
Is she dead?
Is she a dead Pott...?
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
Dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
Don't put away your wand, Harry.
They might come back.
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.
Now, get inside and stay there.
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
There's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
Is that you?
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.
Who did this to you, boy?
Happy, are we, now?
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
As a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
Justice.
He's not very well.
Sorry, Hedwig.
Very clean, these Muggles.
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.
Professor Moody.
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.
But where are we going? The
letter said I've been expelled.
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.
But the letter said...
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.
Not here, Nymphadora.
Don't call me Nymphadora.
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.
Come on, you, around the corner.
Come on.
In you go, son.
There've been no sightings.
No deaths. No proof.
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...
We must trust Dumbledore on this.
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
Heavens, you're all right.
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.
So, what is this place?
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.
It's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.
- Only...
- Only what?
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.
He's not a child, Molly.
But he's not an adult either.
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.
He's as good as.
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.
...about your supposed reformation.
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?
- Get off it.
- Quick.
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.
Hi, Mum.
You hungry, Harry?
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
This is very, very peculiar.
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.
Why?
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
No one in their right
mind could believe that...
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.
It's been twisted and warped by fear.
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.
The last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.
We believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
Something he didn't have last time.
You mean like a weapon?
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.
You say more and you might as
well induct him into the Order.
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.
Harry.
You are hereby expelled.
Before the entire Wizengamot.
Trains. Underground.
Ingenious, these Muggles.
Here we are.
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.
Interdepartmental memos.
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?
In five minutes.
Department of Mysteries.
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be...
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
As the Muggles say, truth will out.
Yes?
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
Good luck, Harry.
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
Witness for the defense.
Albus Percival Wulfric...
...Brian Dumbledore.
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.
The charges?
The charges against the
accused are as follows:
"That he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle."
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.
Dementors?
In Little Whinging?
That's quite clever.
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.
Please describe the attack.
What did they look like?
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.
Not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, big.
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.
Of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.
He is not back.
In the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?
Those in favor of conviction?
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?
Cleared of all charges.
Professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
You'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...
I had to see you off, didn't I?
What's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.
Don't worry about me.
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.
Original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Neville's parents.
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.
It's been 14 years.
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?
It feels like it did before.
You keep it.
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
Hold my hand, lovey.
There they are. They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.
Better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!
It's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.
What is it?
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
It's pulling itself, like always.
You're not going mad.
I can see them too.
You're just as sane as I am.
Everyone, this is Loony Love...
Luna Lovegood.
What an interesting necklace.
It's a charm, actually.
Keeps away the Nargles.
Hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.
Good evening, children.
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.
And how lovely to see all your bright...
...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.
- That's likely.
- That's likely.
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.
Although each headmaster...
...has brought something new
to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.
Let us preserve what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.
Dean, Seamus.
- Good holiday?
- All right.
Better than Seamus', anyway.
Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.
What, your mum believes them?
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?
- You all right?
- Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.
Harry.
Bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
Good morning, children.
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
O-W-Ls.
More commonly known as OWLs.
Study hard and you will be rewarded.
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...
...course of defensive magic. Yes?
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?
Using spells?
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.
We're not gonna use magic?
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.
It is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...
...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?
There is nothing out there, dear.
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
Now, let me make this quite plain.
You have been told...
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
Detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
Enough!
Enough.
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
Come in.
Good evening, Mr. Potter.
Sit.
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
No, not with your quill.
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.
Now...
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."
How many times?
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.
You haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
Yes?
- Nothing.
- That's right.
Because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
Don't you, Mr. Potter?
Go on.
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.
Get out of class whenever you like.
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.
Care for another?
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.
What's wrong with your hand?
Nothing.
The other hand.
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.
You don't understand.
Then help us to.
Dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people, will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...
Different.
But why can't the others see them?
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.
So you've known someone who's died, then?
My mum.
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.
We both believe you, by the way.
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
What do you mean?
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
Can I join you?
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.
So silly of me, but it sounds...
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.
Disloyalty.
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
What's happened to Dumbledore?
Having already revolutionized...
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.
Just one question, dear.
You've been in this post how long, exactly?
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
But you were unsuccessful?
Obviously.
Could you please predict something for me?
I'm sorry?
Move those mouths.
One teensy little prophecy?
Pity.
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
You are in grave danger.
Lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
It's Professor Trelawney.
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
You can't do this.
Actually, I can.
Something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.
There...
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
Thank you.
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.
That power remains with the headmaster.
For now.
Don't you all have studying to do?
Professor.
Professor?
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!
Professor Dumbledore.
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.
She's taking over the entire school.
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances are the work...
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
Harry.
Sirius.
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?
Training you to kill half-breeds?
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.
Combat?
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?
That's exactly what he thinks.
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
Well, what can we do?
Someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.
He really is out there, isn't he?
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.
Harry.
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
Just a couple of people.
Lovely spot.
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.
Matey, come back here.
Hi.
So you all know why we're here.
We need a teacher.
A proper teacher.
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.
- Why?
- Why?
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.
So Dumbledore says because he says.
The point is, where's the proof?
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?
Yes.
I've seen it.
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.
It's true.
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
Wait.
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.
But out there...
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...
You don't know what that's like.
You're right, Harry, we don't.
That's why we need your help.
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
He's really back.
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...
...where Umbridge won't find out.
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?
Who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.
What's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.
Will do, Harry.
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.
The what?
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.
So say you really needed the toilet...
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
I'm hopeless.
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
You will please copy the
approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.
- One Sickle.
- You're on.
Stupefy.
- Thank you.
- Shut up.
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?
It was completely intentional.
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus.
Very good. Keep your concentration.
Great.
A little higher.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.
Diminuendo.
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:
Believing in yourself.
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.
Think of it this way.
Every great wizard in
history has started out...
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.
If they can do it, why not us?
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
So that's it for this lesson.
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.
Well done, mate.
Thanks.
See you after Christmas.
See you in the Common Room, Harry.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
Anyway, it's worth it.
It's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
He was really good.
It's just, Voldemort was better.
You're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able to stun anything before.
Mistletoe.
Probably full of Nargles, though.
What are Nargles?
No idea.
Well, how was it?
Wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
That bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time crying these days.
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
Something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
Neither. It was like I...
Will you please just tell me what's happening?
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
Make sure he's found by the right people.
- Sir.
- Phineas.
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
Look at me!
What's happening to me?
You wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
It appears there's a connection...
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.
Pray he remains ignorant.
You mean, if he knows about it, then...
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you
from access or influence.
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.
You will attempt to resist.
Prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
Here we go.
Daddy's back.
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
There you are.
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.
To Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
- Harry.
- Harry.
Harry.
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
No more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!
Of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.
Sorry about that.
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.
Not to me, anyway.
What, you grew up here?
This is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.
This is the Black family tree.
My deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
My parents with their pure-blood mania.
My mother did that after I ran away.
Charming woman.
I was 16.
Where did you go?
Round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
You are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment when I wanted to...
This connection between me and Voldemort.
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.
You're not a bad person.
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.
You understand?
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.
What matters is the part we choose to act on.
That's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.
You'll see.
Come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
This is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
Giants?
You found them?
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them to join the cause.
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.
And they did this to you?
Not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
It's changing out there.
Just like last time.
There's a storm coming, Harry.
We'd all best be ready when she does.
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.
We strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I wanted to apologize.
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.
Neville?
Fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
She tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.
Wow, that was really good.
Fantastic, Ginny.
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.
So focus, Luna.
Think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
Get them.
Been watching them for weeks.
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
We saw your lies for what they were:
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.
Naturally.
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
I instructed Harry to form this organization.
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
I thought we might hit this little snag.
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...
What was the phrase?
...come quietly.
Well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
Enough of this.
Take him.
Well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Harry.
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?
To go it alone.
Hagrid.
Any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
And they're dangerous at the best of times.
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
Down here, you great buffoon.
Grawpy.
Brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because...
Because he's my brother.
Blimey.
Well, half brother, really.
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
That's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
Put me down.
Now.
You all right?
Fine.
Just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
You just stay away from her, all right?
He gets his own food and all.
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
You will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
Feeling sentimental?
- That's private.
- Not to me.
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.
You're just like your father.
Lazy, arrogant.
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.
Control your emotions.
Discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
Stop it.
Is this what you call control?
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.
The Dark Lord isn't resting.
You and Black, you're two of a kind.
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.
- Legilimens.
- Protego.
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
Nice one, James.
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Enough.
Enough.
Your lessons are at an end.
I...
Get out.
- What's your name?
- Michael.
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
It's fading already.
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children deserve to be punished.
You know, George...
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.
All right, professor!
Here you go.
Ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
You'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
It's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
What do we do?
We'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
Not all of them.
Alohomora.
Alert the Order if you can.
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.
That you are.
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.
Have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.
The last of it on Miss Chang.
Unless you wish to poison him...
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.
...I cannot help you.
He's got Padfoot.
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?
What is he talking about, Snape?
No idea.
Very well.
You give me no choice, Potter.
As this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.
That's illegal.
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
Tell her, Harry!
Tell me what?
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I will.
Where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon.
How much further?
Not far.
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.
What are you doing?
Improvising.
Well?
Where is this weapon?
There isn't one, is there?
You were trying to trick me.
You know...
...I really hate children.
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
Lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
How dare you?
Filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
Please. Please stop it. Please.
Now, enough. I will have order.
You filthy animal.
Do you know who I am?
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.
No, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
But I must not tell lies.
What are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.
Let me go!
Thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.
That was clever, Ron.
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.
So how are we getting to London?
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.
Or was that all just words to you?
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.
So how are we going to get to London?
We fly, of course.
Department of Mysteries.
This is it.
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.
Ninety-four.
Ninety-five.
- He should be here.
- Harry.
It's got your name on it.
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.
For neither can live while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.
Now, hand me the prophecy.
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.
He knows how to play.
Itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
Better, now they're about to be avenged.
Now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
All we want is that prophecy.
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?
You dare speak his name?
You filthy half-blood!
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.
Which is lucky for you, really.
Haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?
Why he was unable to kill you...
...when you were just an infant?
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.
All you have to do...
...is give it to me.
Then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
Well done, Neville.
Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Reducto.
Get back to the door.
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?
The voices.
Can you tell what they're saying?
There aren't any voices, Harry.
Let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
Please, Harry.
Get behind me.
Did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough to think...
...that children stood a chance against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
Give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
Don't give it to him, Harry.
Get away from my godson.
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.
What? No, I'm staying with you.
You've done beautifully.
Now, let me take it from here.
Black.
Expelliarmus!
Nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
No. No.
I killed Sirius Black.
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.
You've got to mean it, Harry.
She killed him. She deserves it.
You know the spell, Harry.
Do it.
So weak.
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, T om.
The Aurors are on their way.
By which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
You've lost, old man.
Harry.
So weak.
So vulnerable.
Look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
It's how you are not.
Harry?
You're the weak one...
...and you'll never know love or friendship.
And I feel sorry for you.
You're a fool, Harry Potter.
And you will lose everything.
He's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
No, you don't.
It's my fault.
No, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.
The prophecy said:
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
The same reason your friends saved you.
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
How come you're not at the feast?
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.
That's awful.
Oh, it's all good fun.
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.
Do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?
That's all right.
Anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.
If not always in the way we expect.
Think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.
What's that?
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.
Yeah?
Something worth fighting for.


CHAPTER 6



Millenium breaking disaster... All river traffic has been halted and police divers search for survivors. Surrounding area remains closed. The man, known to... Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter? Um, no one. Bit of a tosser, really. Funny that paper of yours. Couple of minutes ago, I could have sworn I saw a picture move. Really? While I was going around the train. Okay, I was wondering-- Eleven. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter. You've been reckless this summer, Harry. I like riding around the trains. Takes my mind off things. All unpleasant to be old, isn't it? The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself. But now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm. Do as I say. I hardly just Apparated, didn't I? Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add. Most people vomit the first time. Can't imagine why. Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton. Harry, I assume right about now you must be wondering... why I brought you here? Am I right? Actually sir, after all these years, I just, sort of, go with it. Wands on, Harry. Horace! Horace. Merlin's beard! You don't need to disfigure me, Albus. Well I must say you made a very convincing armchair, Horace. It's all in the upholstery. I come by this stuffing naturally. What gave me away? Dragon's blood. Oh yes, introductions. Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine-- Horace Slughorn. Horace... Well you know who this is. Harry Potter. So for love of theatrics, Horace... You're, by any chance, waiting for someone else, were you? Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean. Alright. The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what's that like? You can only say no to these people so many times. So I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands. Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Yes. Fine. That was fun. Do you mind if I use the loo? No, of course. Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus. The answer is still no. Absolutely, and unequivanetly, no. You're very like your father. Except the eyes, of course. You have your-- My mother's eyes, yeah. Lily, lovely Lily. She's exceedingly bright, your mother. Even more impressive even though I could say that she was Muggle-born. One of my best friends is Muggle-born. She's the best in our year. Oh please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no, no. Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is. Right at the front. All mine. Each and every one. Ex-students, I mean. You recognise Barnabas Cuffe? Editor of the Daily Prophet. Always takes my owl should I wish to register an opinion on the news of the day. Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies. Free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time. Ah, yes! Regulus Black. No doubt, there is his older brother Sirius, died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius. It's a shame. A talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but... but I'd like to set. Horace! Do you mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns. Yes, of course, but you're not leaving, are you? Oh, I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable, I would have considered it a very personal triumph if you consented to return to Hogwarts. Ah well, you're like my friend Mr. Potter here. One of a kind. Well, bye-bye Horace. Bye. Alright. I'll do it. But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. And I expect a raise. These are mad times we're living, mad! They are, indeed. Sir, exactly what was all that about? You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn's gonna try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return. I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was truthfully... very pretty. The girl. It's alright, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse. Oh you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. But sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk? Both are waiting for you. Hedwig? Mom? Ginny, what is it? I was only wondering when Harry got here. What? Harry-- Harry, who? Harry Potter, of course. I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I? His trunk's in the kitchen... and his owl. But no, dear. I seriously doubt that. Harry? Did someone say Harry? Me, nosey. Is he up there with you? Of course not. I think I'll know if my best friend's in my room, wouldn't I? Is that an owl I heard? You haven't seen him, have you? Apparently, he's wandering about the house. Really? Really. Harry! Harry. What a lovely surprise! Why didn't you let us know you were coming? I didn't know. Dumbledore. Oh, that man! What we won't do without him? A bit of... toothpaste. So when did you get here? A few days ago. Day or for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming. Mum... sort of lost it, last week. Said Ginny and I have no business going back to Hogwarts. It's too dangerous. Oh, come on. She's not alone. Even my parents. They're Muggles, know something bad's happening. Anyway, Dad stepped in. Told us she was being barmy and... Took a few days, but she came around. But, this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer? There's been a lot of talk recently that... Dumbledore's got a bit old. What rubbish! Well, he's only... How old is he? Give or take a few years? Cissy, you can't do this! He can't be trusted. The Dark Lord trusts him. The Dark Lord is mistaken. Run along, Wormtail. I-I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this. If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you would not to speak. Put it down, Bella, we mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it, so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa. You? The Dark Lord told you? Your sister darts me. Understandable, over the years, I've played my part well. So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it. I don't doubt you, Severus. You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco. He's just a boy. I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. Severus. Swear to it. Make the Unbreakable Vow. It's just empty words. You'll give it his best effort... when it matters most. He'll just slither back to his hole. Coward. Take out your wand. Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes? I will. And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm? I will. And if Draco should fail, will you yourself carry out the deed the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform? I will. Step up, step up! We got fating fancies. And he's made me go. At just in for time for school. Puking Pastilles. Meeting's in the cauldron, Hanson. Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. How real many spinned it at that one? Handy if you need to make a quick getaway. Hello, ladies. Love potions, eh? Yeah. They really do work. Then again the way we heard you, sis... You're doing just fine on your own. Meaning? Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas? It's none of your business. How much for this? Five galleons. Five galleons. How much for me? Five galleons. Five galleons. I'm your brother. Ten galleons. Ten galleons. Come on, let's go. Hi, Ron. Hi. How are Fred and George doing it? Half the alley's closed down. Fred reckons people need a laugh these days. I reckon he's right. Oh, no. Everyone got their wands from Ollivanders. Harry... Is it me or do Draco and Mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed? Quibbler! Quibbler. He's lovely. They've been known to sing at Boxing Day, you know? Quibbler? Oh, please. What's a Wrackspurt? Invisible creatures, they flow in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler! So what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet? And who were all those people? Don't you see? It was a ceremony. An initiation. Stop it, Harry. I know where you're going with this. It happened. He's one of them. One of who? Harry's under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater. You're barking. What would You-Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy? Oh, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture? It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy blood. Blood? His father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Besides, Hermione saw it with her own eyes. I told you, I don't know what I saw. I need some air. What's going on? What's in that? What's that? What is it? I don't know. What was that? Relax, boys. It's probably just a phantom messing around. Come, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon. Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I think I pitched myself off the astronomy tab I thought I had to continue for another 2 years. What's that supposed to mean? Let's just say I don't think I see me wasting my time in Charms class next year. Amused, Blaise? Let's see just who's laughing in the end. You two go on. Wanna check something. Where's Harry? He's probably on the platform. Come on. Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus! Oh yeah... She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. That's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London. Ennervate! Hello, Harry! Luna. How'd you know where I was? Wrapspurts, your head's full of them. Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna. That's alright. It was like being with a friend. Well, I am your friend, Luna. That's nice. Oh, about time. I've been looking all over for you two. Right... Names? Professor Flitwick, you know me for five years. No exceptions, Potter. Who are those people? Aurors. Security. What's this cane here then? It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick. And what exactly will you be doing with all... be construed as an offensive weapon. It's alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. Nice face, Potter. Would you like me to fix it for you? Personally, I think you look a bit more... devil may care this way but... It's up to you. Well, have you ever fixed a nose before? No, but I've done several toes... How different are they really? Um, okay, yeah. Give it a go. Episkey! How do I look? Exceptionally ordinary. Brilliant! Hermione... I'm here in a minute. Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing. Why won't you turn around, you lunatic? He's covered in blood again. Why is it he's always covered in blood? Looks like it's his own this time. Where have you been? What happened to your face? Later. What did I miss? The Sorting Hat says we ought to be brave and strong in these trouble times. Easy for it to say, though. It's a hat, isn't it? Very best of evenings to you all. Thanks. First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff. Horace Slughorn. Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post... as Potions Master. Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts... will be taken by Professor Snape. As you know, each and every one of you were searched upon your arrival here tonight. And you have the right to know why. Once, there was a young man. Like you, sat in this very hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept under it's roof. You see, to all the world, a student like any other. His name: Tom Riddle. Today of course, is known all over the world by another name. Which is why as I stand, looking out upon you all tonight, I'm reminded of a sobering fact. Every day, every hour, this very minute, perhaps... dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. But in the end, that greatest weapon... is you. Just something to think about. Now off to bed, beep beep. That was cheerful. History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down. Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis, that is the girls' lavatory. Potter. Oh, this can't be good. Enjoying ourselves, are we? I had a free period this morning, Professor. So I noticed. I would think you would want to fill it with Potions. Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror? Well, it was, but I was told to have to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L. So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn's perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with "Exceeds Expectations". Brilliant, um... Well, I'll head there straight away. Oh, good, good. Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there. I don't want to take Potions. There's Quidditch trials coming up, I need to practice. Attention to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all plan. Harry, my boy, I've been beginning to worry. You brought someone with us, I see. Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions. A menace, actually so. I'm probably just gonna-- Nonsense, we'll sort you out. Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out. I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually got my book yet and nor is Ron. Not to worry, get what you want from the cupboard. Now as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...? Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum. And that one-- It's terribly tricky to make. This is Amortentia. The most powerful love potion in the world. It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them. For example, I smell... Freshly mown grass and new parchment and... Spearmint toothpaste. Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible, but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession. And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one. Oh yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion, known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly known referred to as-- Liquid luck. Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck. Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. One sip and you'll find that all of your endeavours succeed. At least until the effects wear off. So this is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Dead. Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. Issue one doubt, however. Only one set of student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all. Let the brewing commence. How did you do that? You crush it, don't cut it. No, the instructions specifically says to cut. No, really. Merlin's beard! It is perfect! So perfect I'd just say one drop would kill us all! Here we are then, as promised. One vial of Felix Felicis. Congratulations. Use it well. Oh Harry, you got my message? Come in. How are you? I'm fine, sir. Enjoying your classes? I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you. I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. Do you? Definitely. What about your activities outside the classroom? Sir? Well, I notice you've spent a great deal of time with Miss Granger. I can't help wondering if-- Oh, no, no, I mean... She's brilliant and we're friends. But no. Forgive me. I was only being curious. But enough chit-chat. You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here. What you're looking at are memories. In this case, pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or as he was known, then: Tom Riddle. This vial contains the most sufficient memory. On the day I first met him. I'd like you to see it. If you want. I'm to admit to some confusion for receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. There have been incidents with the other children-- Nasty things. Tom, you have a visitor. How'd you do, Tom? Don't. You're the doctor, aren't you? No, I'm a professor. I don't believe you. She wants me looked at. They think I'm... different. Or perhaps they're right. I'm not mad. Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. Hogwarts is a school. School of magic. You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things other children can't. I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who mean to me. Can make them hurt. If I want. Who are you? Well, I'm like you, Tom. I'm different. Prove it. I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom. Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom. At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it. You understand me? I can speak to snakes too. They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal for someone like me? Did you know, sir, then? Did I know I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No. If I had, I... Over time while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess who that teacher might be? You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach potions, did you, sir? No, I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something that I desire very dearly. He will not give it out easily. You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect to me. I did. Do you want me to let him? Yes. Okay, so this morning, I'm gonna be putting you all for a few drills just to assess you straight. Quiet, please! Shut it! Thanks. Alright, um, now then, remember, just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear? Good. No hard feelings, Weasley, alright? Hard feelings? Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper's, well, It's... nothing personal. Really? Such a big guy like you? You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think? Keepers need to be quick, agile. I'll have my chances. Say, um, you think you could introduce me to your friend, Granger? Wouldn't mind, eh, getting on a first-hand base, you know what I mean? Come on, come on. Go, Cormac. Come on, Ron! Come on, Ron. Confundus. He's brilliant. I have to admit I thought I was going to miss that last one. I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard. He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione-- Cormac. He's vile. Have you ever heard of the spell: Sectumsempra? No, I haven't. If you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in. Not bloody likely. He's top of the class. He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius. I'd like to know who's that book was. Let's have a look, shall we? No. Why not? The binding is fragile. "The binding is fragile"? Yeah. Who's the Half-Blood Prince? Who? That's what it says right here. This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince. For weeks, you carry around this book. Practically, sleep with it, and yet you have no desire to find out who the Half-Blood Prince is. I didn't say I wasn't curious and I don't sleep with it. Well, it's true. Well, I got a nice chat before I go to bed. And all you do is that bloody book. It's like being with Hermione. Well, I was curious So, I went to-- The library? The library? And? And nothing. I couldn't find a reference anywhere to the Half-Blood Prince. There we go. That settles it, then. Yeah, uh... hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks. Uh no, emergency choir practice from the freighthorse. Does anyone fancy a butterbeer? A chum of mine was sledging down Clagsby Hill. We had a very long, home-made Norwegian style sledge. We hurtled down, we hit what most... Ron, sit aside me. Okay. Something to drink? Three butterbeers and some ginger in mine, please. Oh, bloody hell. Ron, see they're only holding hands. And snogging. I'd like to leave. What? You can't be serious. That happens to be my sister. So? What if she looked at me and saw you snogging me? Would you expect her to get up and leave? Hey, my boy. So wonderful to see you. And you, and you. So what brings you here? Oh, Three Broomsticks and I go way back further than I care to admit. I could remember when it was One Broomstick. All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days, I used to throw together the occassional supper party. Select a student or two. Would you be game? I consider it an honor, sir. You'd be welcome too, Granger. I'd be delighted, sir. Splendid! Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby. What are you playing at? Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him. Get to know him? Dunno. It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask. You got a little bit... Katie, we don't know what it could be. Harry, what... I know what I'm doing. Did you hear what she was saying back in the pub there on me and her snogging? I warned her. I warned her not to touch it. Don't get any closer! Get back, all of you. Oh no, no, no. Do not touch that, except for the wrappings. Do you understand? You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks? It's like I said. She left to go to the loo. And when she came back, she had the package. She said it was important that she deliver it. Did she say to whom? To Professor Dumbledore. Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go. Why is it when something happens, it is always you three? Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years. Oh, Severus. What do you think? I think Ms. Bell is lucky to be alive. She was cursed, wasn't she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly. If she was delivering that to Professor Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly. Yes, she was cursed. It was Malfoy. That is a very serious accusation, Potter. Indeed. Your evidence? I just know. You "just" know. Once again, you're astonished with your gifts, Potter. Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One. I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you. What do you suppose Dean sees in her-- Ginny? And what does she see in him? Dean-- He's brilliant. You called him slick git not five hours ago. Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he? Something snaps. You've got to hate him, you know? Old principle. I suppose. So what do you think he sees in her? I don't know. She's smart, funny, attractive-- Attractive? You know, she's got nice skin. Skin? You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin? For blood, I mean. I'm just--I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor. Hermione's got nice skin. When you say it, as skin goes, I mean. I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. I think I'll be going to sleep now. Right. So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your uncle Tiberius these days? Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant to get hunting with him and the Minister of Magic over the holidays. Oh, well, be sure to give them both my best. And what about your uncle, Belby? For those of you who don't know well, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion. Is he working on anything new? I don't know. He and my dad don't get along. 'Prolly cause my dad says potions are rubbish. His only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day. And what about you, Ms. Granger, what exactly does your family do in the Muggle world? My parents are dentists. They attend to people's teeth. Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession? No. Although, one boy, Robby Fenwich, did bite my father once. He needed ten stitches. Ah, Ms. Weasley. Come in, come in. Look, her eyes. They've been fighting again. Her and Dean. Sorry, I'm not usually late. No matter, just in time for dessert. That is if Belby has left you any. What? Nothing. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Potter! I'm sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass. Ah yes, most intriguing object. The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation. It is stimulating, the sand runs slowly. If it is not... I think I'll be going, then. Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy. Actually, some of your classmates... Well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf. Shelf, sir? Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry? Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher. Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers who was here at Hogwarts. What was he like? I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents. Of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy, committed to becoming a first-grade wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was very deep within. You okay, Ron? I'm counting on you, Ron. I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya? Be good, Ron. Loser! What's he wearing? So how was it, then? How is what? Your dinner party? Pretty boring actually. But I think Harry enjoyed dessert. Slughorn's having Christmas, do you know? I'm about to bring someone. I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he? Actually, I was going to ask you. Really? Good luck today, Ron. I know you'll be brilliant. I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot. Are you alright? Juice? Sure. Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron. Is that why you put something in his cup? Is it a tonic? Liquid luck. Don't drink it, Ron. You could be expelled for that. What are we talking about? Come on, Harry, we've got a game to win. Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! You shouldn't have done it. I know. I supposed I could have just used the Confundus charm. That was different. That was try-outs, this was a natural game. You didn't put in? Ron only thought you did. Charm spell. Just practising. Very good. How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend. Oops! I think this room's taken. What's with the birds? Oppugno. It feels like this. I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it. It's chemical. Will it last? Who knows? Point is I'm a free agent. He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. I really couldn't care less. Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together? Yes. Now, given the circumstances, I had to make other arrangements. Have you? Yes. Why? Well, I just thought seeing is not the risk at going with who we'd really like to, We should go together, as friends. Why didn't I think of that? Who are you going with? Um, it's a surprise. Anyways, you have got to worry about. You can't take anyone. You see that girl over there? That's Romilda Vane. Harry, she's been been trying to smuggle you a love potion. Really? Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One. But I am the Chosen One. Okay, sorry, um... Kidding. I'll ask someone I like. Someone cool. I've never been to this part of the castle. At least, not while awake. I sleep-walk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed. Harmonia nictere passus. Harmonia nictere passus. Harmonia nictere passus. Drink? Neville. I didn't get into the Slug Club. It's okay, though. He's got Melvin hanging up towels in the looroom. I'm--I'm fine, mate. Thanks. Okay. Hermione, what are you doing? What happened to you? No, I've just escaped. I mean, I left Cormac under the mistletoe. Cormac? That's who you invited? I thought it would annoy Ron the most. Thank you very much. We will catch up with you. He's got more tentacles than a Snargaluff plant. Dragon tails? No, I'm fine, thank you. Just this one. They give one horribly bad breath. On second thoughts, it might keep Cormac away. God, here he comes. I think she just went to paddle her nose. She's a little minx, your friend. Nice to work. How nasty isn't she? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is this I'm eating, by the way? Dragon balls. You've just brought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen. Not so quick, Potter. Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date-- Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message. Message? From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holidays. He... He's travelling. And he won't return until term resumes. Travelling where? How are you? Get your hands off me, you filthy Squibb. Professor Slughorn, sir. I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party. Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy? I'll escort him out. Certainly, Professor. Alright, everyone carry on, carry on. Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What about you? I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow. I don't need protection. I was chosen for this. I don't know what all this mean, but I won't fail him. You're afraid, Draco. You attempt to consider, but it's obvious, let me assist you. No. I was chosen. This is my moment. Unbreakable Vow. You sure that's what Snape said? Positive. Why? It's just, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. I-I worked that much out for myself, funny enough. I don't understand. Oh bloody hell. I miss you. Lovely. All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped, look. Then I'll take your word for it. So what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow? You die. Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? I know it sounds mad. Has it occured to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so he could find out what he was up to? Ginny! That's not what it sounded like. Perhaps Harry is right, Remus. I mean, to make an Unbreakable Vow-- It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore, I do. Dumbledore can make mistakes. He said so himself. You are blinded by hatred. I'm not. Yes, you are. People are disappearing, Harry. Daily. We could only place our trust in a handful of people. If we started fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed. Ginny! Open up, you. Don't you trust me? It's good. Just, uh, get... Pie? Not for me. No. You'll have to forgive Remus. It takes its toll, his condition. Are you alright, Mr. Weasley? We're being followed, all of us. Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house. It's not been easy. Did you get my owl? Yes, I did. If Dumbledore is traveling, then perhaps news to the Ministry, but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy... I know a bit more. Go on. I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes. I think from what you described... What you and Ron saw at the end of summer, the object that Draco is so interested in, is a Vanishing Cabinet. A "Vanishing Cabinet"? They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can see the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come knocking, one simply have to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two. It transports you practically anywhere. Tricky contraptions, though. Very temperamental. What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes? Nothing. It's still there. It was delicious, Molly, really. Are you sure you won't stay? No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst. Remus? Sweetheart. Has Ron gone to bed? Um, not yet. No. Shoelace... Merry Christmas, Harry. Merry Christmas. Harry, no! Harry! Remus. Ginny! I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me? Get me! He's trying to get me! Harry? Stupefy! Harry! Ginny! Molly. It's so easy for them to get to you. You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realise who you are, Harry! I know who I am, Hermione, alright. Sorry. Hon, go somewhere. That's my Won-Won. Excuse me, I have to go and vomit. ...Always you ruin half the start. Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? And by the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right. It is my favorite. But how did you know? Intuition. Good gracious, is it that time already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Look sharp, Tom. Don't be caught out of bed after hours. Is something on your mind, Tom? Yes, sir. See, I couldn�t think of anyone else to go to. The other professors... Well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand. Go on. I was in the library the other night. In the restricted section. And I picked something rather odd about this rare magic. I thought perhaps, you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it, Hor... I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Now get out of here at once and don't let me ever catch you mentioning them again! Confused? I'd be surprised if you weren't. I don't understand. What happened? This is perhaps the most important memory I had collected. It is also a lie. This memory has been tempered with by the same person whose memory it is. Our old friend, Professor Slughorn. But why would he temper with his own memory? I suspect he's ashamed of it. Why? Why, indeed. I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you had done so. Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. Any way you can. I don't know him that well, sir. This memory is everything. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail. I highly recommend, reacquaint yourself with the chapter on antidotes. Now, I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go. Elise, don't forget your rat tail. Aha! It isn't the Prince of Potions himself! What do I owe this pleasure? Oh, sir, I wondered if I wanted to ask you something. Ask away, dear boy. Ask away. Well, you see the other day, I was in the library in the restricted section, and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic. Yes, what was this rare piece of magic? Well, I don't know, but I can't remember the name exactly. But it just got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us? I'm Potions Master, Harry, I think your question better be posed to Professor Snape. Yes, he and I don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is... Well, he's not like you. He might misunderstand. Yes, it would be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic, myself I always strive to live within the light. I suggest you do the same. Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir, when he came asking questions? Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he? Didn't he? Yes? Oh, it's you, Potter. I-I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment. That's beautiful, isn't it? The moon. Divine. Had ourselves a little late night snack, did we? It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one. Or twenty? I can't stop thinking about her, Harry. Honestly, you know, I reckon she was starting to annoy you. She could never annoy me. I think I love her. Well, brilliant. Do you think she knows I exist? I very well hope so. She's been snogging you for three months. Snogging? Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane. Okay, very funny. What was that for? It's no joke. I'm in love with her! Alright, fine. You're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her? No. Can you introduce me? Come on, Ron. I will introduce you to Romilda Vane. I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential. Where's Romilda? What's the matter with Wimby? Very powerful love potion. Very well, better bring him in. I always thought you could whip up a remedy for this is in no time, Harry. Well, I-I thought this called for more practised hands, sir. Hello, darling. Fancy a drink? Perhaps, you're right. I'm sorry, by the way, Professor, about earlier today. Our misunderstanding. Oh, not at all. Old water under the bridge, you know. Correct? Well, I expect you're tired a bit, after all these years. And the questions about Voldemort. Don't use that name! Here you go, boy. Bottom's up. What's this? Tonic for the nerves. What happened to me? A love potion. A bloody strong one at there. I feel really bad. You need to pick me up, my boy. Got butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances. Here you are, Potter. To life! Ron! Ron! Professor, do something. I-I don't understand! Come on, Ron, breathe! These girls... They're gonna kill me. Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar. You should be very proud of your student, Horace. Ah, yes. Very proud. I think we agree Potter's actions were heroic. The question is: Why were they necessary? I, indeed. This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't remember who gave you this bottle? By the way, it possesses remarkably subtle hints of liquorice and cherry. When not polluted with poison. Actually, I had intended to give it as a gift, myself. To whom, might I ask? To you, headmaster. Where is he? Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here? I might ask you the same question. I happen to be his girlfriend. And I happen to be his... friend. Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks. I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting. He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting. See? He senses my presence. Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here. I'm here. Hermione. Hermione. Hermione. Oh to be young and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come over, everybody. Mr. Weasley's well attended. About time, don't you think? Thank you. Just shut up. Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow. Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again. Well, she came to visit you in the hospital. And you talked. I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation. Don't get me wrong. I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her's. She seems a bit... put out. Yes, um... She does, isn't she? You say you don't remember anything from that night. Anything at all? There is something. It can't be. I was completely boggled, didn't I? Boggled. Harry... That's Katie. Katie Bell. Katie, how are you? I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've been trying to remember. Honestly. But I just can't. Katie. I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed it, didn't you? Sectumsempra! You have to get rid of it. Today. Take my hand. It's the Room of Requirement. We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book. Where no one'll ever find it. Including you. What was that? What was that? See, you never know what you'll find up here. Alright, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted. Close your eyes. S u B: V e R d i K That can stay hidden up here too if you like. So, did you and Ginny do it then? What? Well, hide the book? Oh, yeah. Oh, g-- Still no luck with Slughorn then, I take it? Luck. That's it. All I need is a bit of luck. Well, how do you feel? Excellent. Really excellent. Remember, Slughorn usually leaves early, takes a walk, and then returns to his office. Right. I'm going down to Hagrid's. What? No, Harry, you've got to go to speak to Slughorn. We have a plan. I know but I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's--it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean? No. No. Well, trust me. I know what I'm doing. Or Felix does. Hi! Merlin's beard, Harry! Sorry, sir. I should have announced myself. Clear my throat. Coughed. You probably thought I was Professor Sprout? Definitely. What makes you think? Ah well, just your general behaviour, sir. Just sneaking around, jumping when you saw me. Are those tentacular leaves, sir? Yes. They're very valuable, aren't they? Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer. Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions but one does hear rumours. My only interests are purely academical. I mean, personally, these plants always kinda freak me out. Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry? Through the front door, sir. I'm off to Hagrid's, you see. He's a very dear friend and I just fancy paying him a visit. So if you don't mind, I will be going now. Harry! Sir? It's nearly nightfall. Surely, you realise I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself. Well then, by all means, come along, sir. Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately! That would be counterproductive, sir. And what makes you say that? No idea. Horace. Merlin's beard! Is that an actual Acromantula? A dead one, I think, sir. Good God. Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it? "Kill it"? My oldest friend, he was. I'm so sorry, I didn't-- Ah, don't worry yourself. You're not alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. The eyes I reckon, they unnerve some folk. Not to mention the pincers. Yeah, I reckon that too. Hagrid... The last thing I wish to be is indelicate but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare. Would you allow me to extract a vial or two, purely for academic purposes, you understand? Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him much good now is it. My thoughts exactly. I have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occassions as this. Old... Potion master's habit, you know? I wish you could have seen him with his prime. Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent. Would you like me to say a few words? Yes. Had a family, I trust? Oh, yeah. Farewell... Aragog. Farewell, Aragog. King of the arachnids. Your body will decay... but your spirit lingers on and your human friends find solace, the loss they have sustained. # Laid to rest, # # And his wand, snapped in two, # # Which was sad, # I had him from an egg, you know? Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. No bigger than a Pekingese. A Pekingese, mind you. How sweet! I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me. One afternoon, I came downstairs and... it vanished. Poof. That's very odd, isn't it? Yes, doesn't it? But that's life! I suppose, you--you go along with and suddenly... poof. Poof. Poof. It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon, I discovered the bowl on my desk... With just a few inches of clear water in it... And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. But just before it reached the bottom, it transformed into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic. Wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs, day's the bowl was empty. That's the day your mother... I know why you're here. But I can't help you. It would ruin me. Do you know why I survived, Professor? The night I got this? Because of her, because she sacrificed herself... Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. Don't say his name. I'm not afraid of the name, Professor. I'm going to tell you something. Something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One. Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise, you disgrace her. Otherwise, she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty. Forever. Please, don't think badly of me when you say it. I had no idea what he was like, even then. I was in the library the other day. In the restricted section... and I read something rather odd about this rare magic. It's called, as I understand it, a Horcrux. I beg your pardon? Horcrux. I came across the term while reading... and I didn't fully understand it. I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. Very dark, indeed. Which is... why I came to you. A horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. But I don't understand how that works, sir. One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed. Protected? That part of your soul which is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die. And how does one splits his soul, sir? I think you already know the answer to that, Tom. Murder. Yes, killing rips the soul apart and it is a violation against nature. Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven-- Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul in seven pieces! This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic? Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret. Sir. This is beyond anything I imagined. Do you mean, sir, he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux? Oh yes, he succeeded, alright. And not just once. What are they exactly? It could be anything. Most common place of objects. A ring, for example, or a book. Tom Riddle's diary. It's a horcrux, yes. Four years ago when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this. I knew then, this was a different kind of magic. Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful... And the ring? Belonged to Voldemort's mother. Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux-- One destroys Voldemort. How would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they? True, but magic, especially dark magic... leaves traces. It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir? When you leave the school. Yes, and I think perhaps, I may have found another. But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry. Have you ever considered that you ask too much, that you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore? Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant. I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss. Oh, Harry... You need a shave, my friend. You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown. At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I'm an old man. You still look the same to me, sir. Just like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid. The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous. I promise you for the company of me and I stand by that promise. But there's one condition. You must obey every command I give you without question. Yes, sir. You do understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you hide. Should I tell you to run, you run. Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so. Your word, Harry. My word. Take my arm. Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts. Well, being me has its privileges. This is the place. Oh, yes. This place has known magic. Sir. In order to gain passage, payment must be made. Payment intended to weaken any intruder. You should have let me, sir. No, no, Harry. Your blood's much more precious than mine. Voldemort would not have made it easy to discover his hiding place. He would put certain defenses in position. Careful. There it is. The only question is how do we get there? If you would, Harry. Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? Oh, yes. It has to be drunk. All of it has to be drunk. You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me. I may risk to get what I'm here. I'd cause me so much pain that I'd beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests. It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion. Even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood? Why can't I drink it, sir? Because I'm much older, much cleverer and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry. Professor. Professor! Professor. Can you hear me? Professor! You have to keep drinking like you said, remember? Stop. I will stop. I will stop. But only-- only if you keep drinking. Don't make me-- Kill me. I'm sorry, sir. Kill me! All my fault. My fault. Just one more, sir. One more, I promise. I promise I'll do what you say. No, no. I promise! Please! Harry. Water. Water. Water. Look, you did it, sir. Look. Harry... water. Aguamenti! Water. Lumos. Lumos maxima! Stupefy! Stupefy! Sectumsempra! Harry... Incarcerous! Stupefy! Harry... Harry... Partis Temporus! Go to your houses! No toddling! We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir. To Madam Pomfrey. No... Severus, Severus is awakening. Wake him. Tell him what happened. Speak to no one else. Severus, Harry. Hide yourself below, Harry. Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission. Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below. Harry, do as I say. Trust me. Trust me. Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine spring evening? Who else is here? I heard you talking. I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you always been to yourself, Draco? Draco, you are no assassin. How do you know what I am? I've done things that would shock you. Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she would bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one lace with poison. Forgive me, Draco, I cannot help feel these actions are so weak that your... heart can't really have been in. He trusts me. I was chosen. I shall make it easy for you. Expelliarmus! Very good. Very good. You're not alone. There are others. How? The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I've been mending it. Let me guess, it has a sister. A twin. In Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage. Ingenious. Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you. I don't want your help. Don't you understand? I have to do this. I have to kill you. Or he's gonna kill me. Oh, look what we have here. Well done, Draco. Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions aren't over, don't you? Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of tight schedule. Do it! He doesn't have the stomach. Just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way. No, the Dark Lord was clear the boy has to do it. This is your moment, Draco. Do it! Go on, Draco, now! No. Severus. Please... Avada Kedavra. Hagrid! Snape, he trusted you! Go on! Incarcerous! Fight back, you coward! Fight back! No, he belongs to the Dark Lord. Sectumsempra! You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? Yes, I'm the Half-Blood Prince. Potter... Enlighten what has happened. If you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know... Professor Dumbledore... You meant a great deal to him. Do you think he would have done it? Draco. No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. I did nothing. It was fake. Open it. To the Dark Lord: I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B. R.A.B.? Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. It means it was all a waste. All of it. Ron's okay with you, you know. You and Ginny. If I were you when he's around, I'd keep snogging to a minimum. I'm not coming back, Hermione. I got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll leave me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can. I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry. I never realised how beautiful this place was.

CHAPTER 7



- Hermione, tea is ready, Darling
- I'm coming, Mom!
C'Mon Dudley hurry up
I still don't understand
why we have to leave?.
Because its
not safe around here anymore
Ron??
evening is finished.
Obliviate. / i
HARRY POTTER AND
THE DEATHLY HALLOWS / i
Severus, I was beginning to worry
you'd lost your way...
...Come, we have saved you a seat
- You bring news, I trust
- It will happen next Saturday.
At nightfall
I've heard differently
my lord.
Dawlish, the auror has let slip
that the Potter boy will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.
The day before he turns 17
This is a false trail
The auror office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him think
that we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Well, they got that right., didn't they ?
What say you , Pius?
One hears many things
my lord.
But whether the truth is
among them, is not clear.
Spoken like a true politican.
you will I think
prove most useful, Pius.
- Where will he be taken the boy?
- To a safe house.
Most likely the home
of someone in the Order.
I'm told its been given protection
of every manner possible
Once there it will be
impractical to attack him
My lord, I'd like to
volunteer myself for this task.
I want to kill the boy
Wormtail
Have i not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet ?
Yes, my lord.
Right away, my lord.
As inspiring as I find
your bloodlust, Bellatrix ...
... I must be the one
to kill Harry Potter.
But I face an
unfortunate complication.
My wand and the Potters
share the same core.
They are, someways, twins.
We can wound but not
fatally harm one another.
If I am to kill him ...
... must do it with
anothers wand
Well, surely one of you
would like the honor
What about you, Lucius?
- My lord?
- "My Lord"?
I require your wand.
- Do I detect elm?
- Yes, my Lord.
And the core?
- Dragon heartstring my lord
- Dragon heartstringt?
To those of you who do not know ...
...we are joined here tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage ...
... who until recently taught
at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry
Her speciality was muggle studies
It is Miss Burbage's belief that
Muggles are not so different. than us
She would given her way ...
... have us mate with them.
To her the mixture of magical and
Muggle blood is not an abomination ...
... but something,
to be encouraged.
Severus.
Severus, please.
We're friends.
Nagini.
Dinner.
- Hello Harry!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- You're looking fit.
Yeah, he is absolutely gorgeous...
Lets say we get undercover,
before someone blows you..
Do you?
Kingsley, weren't you looking
after the PrimeMinister?
You are more important.
- Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- He wasn't always so handsome
- Daredevil.
- True enough
Happened while fighting a werewolf called Greyback
I Would like to return the favour one day
You're still beautiful to me, Billy.
Just remember, Fleur
Bill takes his steak on the raw side now
My husband the joker.
By the way,
Wait till you hear the news....
Can't wait no time for cozy catch up.
We have to get the hell out of here.
Potter, you are underage, which means
you've still got the trace on you.
What is the trace?
If you sneezed, the Ministry
will know who wiped your nose.
The point is that we have to use those modes,
of transport which the trace can't detect
Brooms, thestrals and like
We'll go in pairs.
That way if anything is out there waiting
for us...I reckon there will be
... they won't know which
Harry Potter is the real one.
The real one ?
I do believe you are fully
aware of this particular brew
- No, absolutely not.
- I told you he won't take it well.
No, if you think that I'll let,
everyone risk their lives for me ...
- Have done if before, haven't we.
- No, no, this is different.
Taking that becoming me.
No!
Well none of us really
fancy it mate
Yes, imagine if something went wrong,
and we be stuck as scrawny specky gits forever
Everyone here is of age, Potter.
They all agreed to take the risk.
Technically I'd been coerced
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Aways been a huge admirer.
Nip it, Mundungus.
- Alright Granger its discussed
- Blimey, Hermione!
Put it in there, please.
For those of you who haven't taken
polyjuice potion before, fair warning.
Tastes like goblin piss
Have enough of that
experience do you Mad-eye?
Just trying to defuse the
tension.
- Wow! we are identical!
- Not yet you are not.
- Haven't you got something a bit more sporting?
- Yeah I don't really fancy this color.
Well fancy this , you are not you
so shove it up and strip
Alright, Alright
You too, Potter.
Bill, look away, I'm hideous.
- Ginny did lie about that tattoo.
- Harry, your eyesight really is aweful.
Well,we will be pairing off.
Everyone will have a protector.
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I want to keep an eye on you
- As for Harry ...
- Yes?
The real Harry.
Where the devil are you anyway?
- Here.
- You ride with Hagrid.
I brough you here 16 years ago,
when you were no bigger than a bowtruckle.
Seems only right that
I should be the one that takes you away.
Yes this is all very touching.
Lets go !
Head for the Burrow.
We rendezvous you there.
- On the count of three!
- Hold tight, Harry!
One!
Two!
Three!
Help!
- Hagrid, we have to help the others!
- We can't do that, Harry
Mad-Eye's orders.
Hang on!
Stupefy! / i
Hang on, Harry!
Hagrid!
No! No!
Harry!
Hagrid! Hagrid!
What happened?
Where are the others?
Is noone else back?
They were on to us
way from the start, Molly.
We didn't stand a chance.
Well, thank goodness
you two are allright
Death Eaters were waiting
for us. Attacked us.
George and Ron
should have been back.
A dad with Fred too.
Here.
Quick.
Into the house.
Oh My boy ...
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
What creature sat in the corner the first time when
Harry Potter visited of my office in Hogwarts.
- Are you mad?
- What creature?
A Grindylow.
We have been betrayed .
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.
I had to make sure,
you were not an imposter.
Wait!
The last words Albus Dumbledore,
spoke to the pair of us.
"Harry is the best hope we have."
"Trust him."
What gave you away?
Hedwig i think.
She was trying to protect me.
Thanks.
He deserves that. Brilliant he was.
I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him.
Really?
Why is it always so suprising?
We are the last back?.
Where's George?
How are you feeling, Georgie?
- Saintlike.
- Come again?
Saintlike.
Im holey. I'm holey fred
Get it?
A whole wide world of ear related
humour and you go for holey.
Pathetic.
I'm still better looking than you.
Mad-Eye is dead.
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and disapparated.
head for the burrow / i
- Seven. Seven.
- This is more than I ever imagined. / I
- Horcruxes ...
- They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they. / i
to tear the soul
into seven pieces .../ i
- If we destroy each Horcruxes ...
- One destroys Voldemort. / I
- Harry ...
- Trust me. / I
- Do not lie to me. Do not lie to me.
- Not / i
Going somewhere?
Nobody else is going to die.
Not for me.
Because of you?
You think Mad-Eye died
for you?
Think George
took that curse for you?
You maybe the chosen one, mate ...
... but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
Its always been bigger than that.
- Come with me.
- And leave Hermione?
Are you mad.
We won't last two days.
without her
Do not tell her
I said that.
Besides you still have the trace on you,
you still got the wedding ...
... the wedding ...
- I don't care about a wedding.
I'm Sorry, no matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes?.
They are our only chance,
to beat him.
And the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.
Try and understand me
You will only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
I mean they are bits of his soul,
the Horcruxes.
Pieces of him.
When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring ...
... and you destroyed
Tom Riddle's Diary.
He must have felt something?.
To kill thei other Horcruxes,
we have to find them?.
Where are they?
Where do we start?
DUMBLEDORE'S DARK SECRETS REVEALED
RITA SKEETER LAUNCHES NEW BOOK / i
DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED
BY ELPHIAS DOGE/ i
Zip me up, will you ?
It seems silly doesn't it
the wedding
considering whats
going on
Maybe thats the best reason to have it.
inspite of whats going on
Morning.
All together now!
One! Two! Three!
How it it going?
Great.
Well, hell.
What is the Minister of Magic doing here?
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.
Herein is is said forth
...?
the last will and testament of ...
... Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.
First, to
Ronald Billius Weasley ... "
"... I leave my delumintor."
"A device, of my own making ..."
"... In hope when things
seem most dark ... "
"... it will show you the light."
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yes.
Really.
What is it?
Super.
" To Hermione Jean Granger ..."
"... I leave my copy of
Tales of Beedle the Bard / i ..."
"... In the hope that she finds it
entertaining and instructive "
Mom used to tell me those.
The wizard and the hopping pot,
Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump ...
Come on.
Babbity Rabbity...
No?
"To Harry James Potter ..."
"... I leave the snitch he caught
in his first match at Hogwarts... "
"... As a reminder of
rewards of perseverance ... "
"... And skill."
Is that it then?
Not quite.
Dumbledore left you ...
... a second bequest
The sword of
Godric Gryffindor.
Unfortunately the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.
As an important
historical artifact it belongs ...
to Harry.
It belongs to Harry.
It came to him when he most
needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
The sword may present itself to
any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger ...
... but that does not make it
that wizards property
Unfortunately the current
whereabout of the sword are unknown.
Excuse me?
The Sword is Missing.
I don't know what you are up,
to, Mr. Potter ...
... but you can't fight
this war on your own
He is too strong.
Hello, Harry.
i've interrupted
deep thoughts, haven't I?
I see a growing
in your eyes
Of course not.
How are you, Luna?
Very well, The garden
gnome has bitten my finger...
Gnome saliva is s very benificial.
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I trust you know
Mr. Potter ...
... we at the Quibbler, disagree with Daily Prophet,
and have always fully supported Dumbledore ...
... during his lifetime and after his death,
and we also support you.
Thank you.
Come Daddy.
Harry does not want to talk to us right now?.
He is just too polite
to point it out.
Harry Potter ...
Excuse me, sir.
- May I sit down?
- Mr. Potter.
By all means...here
I found what you wrote
in the Daily Prophet.
really moving.
You obviously knew
Dumbledore well.
Well, I certainly
knew him the longest.
Unless we count his brother Aberforth,
and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth.
I didn't even know
he had a brother.
Ah Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.
Do not despair, Elphias.
I'm told he has been thoroughly
unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.
in 800 pages.
Word has it
that someone talked to her.
Someone who knew the
Dumbledore family well.
Both you and I know
who that is , Elphias.
Monstrous betrayal.
Who are we talking about?
Bathilda Bagshot.
- Who?
- Oh, boy ...
... she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.
She was as close to Dumbledore
as anyone
Sure Rita Skeeter thought it well
worth a trip to Godric's Hollow ...
... to take a peek into
that old birds records.
Godris Hollow?
Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Thats where she first met Dumbledore.
You don't say thar he lived there too.
His family moved
there ...
... after his father killed
those three Muggles.
It was a quite the scandal.
Honestly my boy ...
... are you sure
that you knew him at all?
Ministry has fallen. / i
Minister of Magic is dead. / i
They are coming. / i
They are coming. / i
Nice meeting you,
Mr. Potter.
Ginny!
Go! Go!
Where are we?
Shaftesbury Avenue.
I used to come up here to theaters
with mom and dad.
I do not know why I though of it. It was
the first thing to come to my head
This way.
Have you ever seen this before?
Kreacher?
- It is Master Regulus's locket!
- There were two, weren't there?
Where is the other one?
Kreacher deosn't know
about the other locket.
Yes, but did you ever see it?
It was in this house.
Flithy mudblood...bloodtraitor Weasley!
Answer her.
Yes It was here, in this house.
Most evil object.
- What do you mean?
- Before Master. Regulus died ...
... he ordered Kreacher to destroy the locket,
but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.
Well, where is it now?
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.
He took many things
including the locket.
Who?
Who was it, Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus Fletcher.
Find him.
My father will hear about this.
Hey loosers.
He isn't here.
HARRY POTTER
UNDESIRABLE NUMBER 1 / i
As your new Minister of Magic ...
... I promise to restore this temple
of tolerance to its former glory.
MAGIC IS MIGHT / i
- Therefore beginning today ...
... each employee will submit
themselves... to evaluation
.
But know this, that you
have nothing to fear...
... if you have nothing to hide.
They have flesh memories.
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought, that it might open at to your touch.
Dumbledore could have
hidden something inside it.
- Harry Potter!
- Zlezte of me!
Expelliarmus / i
What are you playing at?
Setting a pair of bleeding
elf on me?
Dobby was only trying to help.
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley ...
... which Dobby thought was curious and then
Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.
And then Dobby saw Kreacher
talking with the thief.
Me a thief ?
You foul little ...
- You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it.
- Mr. Weasley.
- So good to see you.
- Nice shoes.
Listen.
I panicked, alright?
He was right on me and
Mad-Eye fell off his broom
- You ...
- Tell the truth.
When you turned this place over, don't deny it
You found a locket am I right?
Boy, was it valuable?
Bleeding gave it away, didn't I ?
There I was selling my goods ...
... when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see my license.
she says
she would lock me up?.
Would have done too if she
didn't take a fancy to that locket.
Who was it?
The witch, do you know her?
No ...
Oh ! She's there.
Look.
Its that old hag
MINISTRY SEEKS
EDUCATIONAL REFORM / i
Right
Remember what we said.
Don't speak to anybody,
Unless it is absolutely necessary.
Just ...
Try and act normal.
Do what everybody
else is doing.
Do that and with a bit of luck
we'll get inside.
- And then ...
- It gets really tricky.
Right.
- This is completely mental.
- "Completely ?"
The world is mental.
Come on.
We have a Horcrux to find.
We have to flush
ourselves in.
Its bloody Disgusting.
- Are those ...?
- Muggles.
In there ... rightful place.
Let me tell you
stop to freak out a bit.
How long did you say
this polyjuice potion will last, Hermione?
I didn't.
Cattermole.
Its still raining inside my
office. Its been two days now.
Have you tried an umbrella?
You realize i'm going downstairs
don't you, Cattermole?
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.
Now if my wife's
blood status were in doubt ...
... and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement
needed a job doing ...
... I think I might just
make that a priority
You have one hour.
Oh my god,
what am I gonna do?
My wife is all alone
downstairs.
Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh right.
- Level 2
- How do I stop it raining
- Try Finite Incantatem. / I
This is you, Ron.
Finite Incantatem. / i
Okay.
And if it doesn't work?
I say if don't locate Umbridge within the hour,
we find Ron and come back another day.
- Deal?
- Yes.
Ah, Mafalda
Trevor sent you, did he?
Good.
We'll go straight down.
Albert, weren't you getting out?

Runcorn?
Morning.

Blimey!
I forgot what you look like.
- Where is Hermione?
- She's gone down to the court rooms, with Umbridge.
I am half blood.
My father was a wizard.
He worked there 30 years.
Perhaps you know him.
He Always wore a jacket or vice versa.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole,
- Yes.
- It's here.
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred;
Wife to Reginald?
Regi.
Thank you, Albert.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole.
Yes?
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry Mrs Cattermole
Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court,
from witch or wizard you took this wand ?
No one.
I bought it in Diagon Alley,
by Ollivanders, when I was 11.
It chose me.
You are lying. Wands choose only witches,
and you're not a witch.
But I am.
Tell them, Reg, tell them I am.
What on Earth are you doing, Albert?
You are lying, Dolores.
One must not tell lies.
Stupefy! / i
- It's Harry Potter!
- It is him. Its okay to tell the kids.
Expecto patronum! / i
Mary.
Go on home.
Take the kids
I'll meet you there.
We have to leave the country, do you understand?
Mary, do as I say.
Mary?
Who is that?
Long story...
Nice meeting you.
Harry Potter.
It's Harry. Harry Potter.
Harry.
Harry, quickly, in my bag.
There is a bottle labeled
Essence of Dittany. / i
Quickly!
Accio Dittany! / i
Good.
Unstopper it.
Hermione, his arm.
I know just do it!
Its gonna...
This is gonna Sting a little bit
What happened? I thought we
were going to go back to Grimmauld Place.
We were.
Alright, One more, One more
We were there we were there but,
Yaxley got a hold of me ...
... and he saw
where we went ...
... We couldn't stay there,
so I brought us here, but ...
... Ron splinched.
It's good.
Protego Totalum. / i
- Salvia Hexi. / i
- What are you doing?
Protective enchantments.
I do not want a repeat of what happened at
Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?
-Get going with a tent
- Tent?
- Protego Totalum. / i
- Where am I supposed to find a tent?
Repello Mukletum.
Muffliato. / I

Incendio. / i
Expulso / i
Diffindo / i
Reducto / i
What are you doing?
We have to keep it safe,
until we find out how to destroy it.
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sent you out to find those Horcruxes
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them
Doesn't it bother you?
You know the spell, Harry. / i
- Tell me, Gregorovitch.
- He stole it from me.
Who was it?
The thief?
The boy.
It was he who took it.
I never saw it again
I swear on my life.
I believe you.
Avada Kedavra! / i
I thought
it stopped.
You can't keep
, Harry.
- You-Know- Who found Gregorovitch.
- This Wand Maker?
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have.
I do not know what.
But he wants it desperately.
As if his life depended on it
.
Don't, its his comfort zone.
??
It sets my teeth on edge,,
Whats he expecting to hear?? Good news?
One can only hope
not to hear bad news.
How long before he can travel?
- I'm doing everyting I can.
-You are not doing enough?
Take it off!
I said,
Take it off, now!
- Better?
- Right .
We will take in turns, okay?
What is that?
Snatchers.
Good to know,
that your enchantments work.
He could smell it.
my perfume.
I told you
Ron is not strong enough to apparate.
So we will go on foot then.
Only next time, even when I like
your perfume, do not use it.
The names of missing...
. / i
These are confirmed. / i
Oh, thank you.
He doesn't know what he is doing? does he?
None of us do.
- Oh My God !
- What?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
- You can tell me now?
Sword of Gryffindor .
Its goblin made
Brilliant.
No, you don't understand.
Dirt and dust
have no effect on the blade.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger.
Okay ...
we are looking for a way to destroy horcrux , right ?
- Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
- With a basilisk.fang
If you tell me you got ,
one of those in that bloody beeded bag of yours ...
Don't you see? In The Chamber of Secrets
you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor
Its blade is impregnated with
basilisk venom.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger
- Exactly, which is why
- It can destroy Horcruxes.
Thats why Dumbledore
left it to you in his will.
You're brilliant, Hermione.
Truely.
Actually, I just highly logical thinking,
which allows to me see past and irrelevant details ...
... and perceived cleary which
others overlook
Yeah, there is only one problem.
Someone stole the sword.
Hey, I'm still here.
You two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.
I told you everything
that Dumbledore told me!
Incase you haven't noticed
We have found one Horcrux already.
Yes, and we are as close to getting rid
of it as we are to finding the rest, aren't we?
Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux ...
you wouldn't have spoken like this
if you hadn't wore it all day
You know, why I listen to the radio every night?
To make sure that i don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or moms ...
You think i don't know that ?
- You think i don't know how it feels?
- You don't know how it feels!
Your parents are dead!
You have no family!
- Stop! Stop!
- Let me Go!
- Go Then
Ron ...
And you?
Are you coming or
are you staying?
Fine. I get it.
I saw you two the other night.
Ron's ...
There is nothing.
Ron!
Ron, where are you going?
Come back, now!
Salvia Hexi
I opens at the close / i
Hermione?
Hermione?
You were right.
Snithced have flesh memory ...
... but I did not catch the first snitch with my hand.
I almost swallowed it.
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?
I don't know.
I found something as well
At first I thought it was an eye
it's eye, but now I don't think it is.
And it's no rune,
it is anywhere in Spellmans syllabury.
Someone wrote it there.
Somebody inked it in
it isn't part of the book
Luna's dad was wearing that at
the wedding of Bill and Fleur.
Why would someone draw
it in a childrens book?
Hermione, I've been thinking
I want to go to Godric's Hollow
Its where I was born ,
Its where my parents died.
Thats exactly why they'll expect you to go
it means something to you
But it means something to
him too, Hermione.
You-Know-Who almost died there.
Isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?
It is dangerous, Harry.
But I admit it recently I've been thinking
we have to go there
I think its is possible that
something else is hidden there.
What?
The Sword.
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
and to not let it fall into the hands of the Ministry ...
... what better place to hide it
than the birthplace of founder of Gryffindor
Hermione ...
Don't tell me I have to give
you a haircut again
I still think that we
should use Polyjuice Potion.
No.
This is where I was born.
I don't want to return?,
as someone else.
Harry, I think it is Christmas eve.
Listen.
Do you think they are here, Hermione?
My mom and dad.
I think so.
Ignotus Peverell.
Hey, Harry?
Merry Christmas, Hermione.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Harry, someone is watching us.
Near the church.
I think I know who it is.
- I don't know this, Harry.
- Hermione, Dumbledore knew.
She might have the sword.
This is where they died, Hermione.
This is where he murdered them.
Bathilda, aren't you ?
Leave it, let me do that.
Miss Bagshot,
Who is this man?
Harry!
Are you feeling better?
This time can be overcome,
Hermione.
Forest of Dean.
I came here once with my mother and father.
Years ago.
Its just
how I remember it.
Trees, the river, everything.
Like nothings changed.
This of course is true,
everything has changed.
If there were my parents,
they would have nothing nepamtali.
Or trees.
Or river.
Not even me.
Perhaps we should
stay here, Harry.
Grow old?.
You wanted to know
Who was the boy in the photograph was.
I know.
Gellert Grindelwald.
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's wandshop.
Speaking of which
where's my wand?
Where's my wand, Hermione?
As we were leaving Godrics Hollow I cast a curse.
and it rebounded
I'm sorry.
I tried to mend it,
But wands are different.
Its nothing.
Lend me yours.
Go inside and get warm.
I'll take the locket as well.
Lumos. / i
Accio sword! / i
Diffindo. / i
Hermione?
Are you mental?
Ron, is that you?
Yes.
Didn't hurt yourself did you ?
- You cast the doe as well did you?
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.
Clear.
Okay, Ron.
Do it.
I can not. The thing affect me more
as you and Hermione.
- All the more reason
- I can not.
then why are you here?
Why did you come back?
I'll have to speak to it to open it
When it does, don't hesitate.
I don't know whats in there, but it will put up a fight?.
The bit of Riddle in the diary was trying to kill me?.
One.
Two.
Three.
and I see your heart and it is mine. / i
I see your dreams,
Ronald Weasley. / I
I see your fear. / i
hated her mother,
who longed for a daughter. / i
Not My Favorites girl? om,

Ron!

happy without you ? astnej. / i
Who would choose you .../ i
... compared to Harry Potter? / i
What are you compared to the chosen one? / i
Ron, its lying!
Your mother confessed,
she would prefer as a son. / i
What woman would take you? / i

Nothing...Nothing / I
Nothing compared to him. / i
Just think
There are only three to go.
Hermione?
Hermione?
Is everything alright?
Fine...
Actually its more than fine.
Hi.
You ...
... a complete arse of,
a Weasley!
You show up here after weeks
and you say 'hey'?
Where's my wand, Harry?
- Where is my wand?
- I don't know.
Harry Potter
You give me my wand!
-What happened to your wand?
- Nevermind he's got my wand.
What is that?
You destroyed it.
And how is it that you just happened to have the
sword of Gryffindor ?
It's a long story.
Don't think
it changes anything.
Of course not. I only destroyed a
bloody Horcrux, why will that change anything.
I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.
-just didn't know how to find you
- how did you found us ?
With this. Doesn't just
Turn out lights
I don't know how it works
but christmas morning I sleping in this little pub ...
... keeping away from some snatchers.
- When I heard it.
- What?
Voice.
Your voice, Hermione.
comin out of it.
And what exactly did I say
if I may ask??
My name.
Just my name.
like a Whisper
So I took it, clicked it ...
... this tiny ball of light appeared
And I knew.
sure enough.
Flew towards me,
ball of light.
Right into my chest.
Straight through me.
Right here
I knew that it was gonna take me
where I needed to go
so I disapparated
came to this hillside
It was dark, I had
no idea where I was.
I just hoped
One of you will show yourself
you did
I have always liked these flames
Hermione makes.
How long do you think
she will stay mad at me?
i don't know ...
just keep talking about that little ball,
and it might touch her in the heart ...
... and she will come around.
- It's true. Every word.
This is gonna sound crazy.
But I think,thats why Dubledore left it to me
The delumintor.
I think somehow he knew
I'll need to find my way back
Hey, I just realized
you need a wand, don't yout?
I got one here.
Blackthorn 10 inches ,
nothing special.
- But be uploaded with just. - I took off
a snatcher few weeks ago
Don't tell hermione this
Definitely was a troll,
by the smell of it.
Engorgio. / i
Finite / i
We need to talk.
Yeah, alright
I want to go see
Xenophilius Lovegood.
Sorry?
See this ? It is a letter
Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.
Look at the signature.
It's the mark again
It keeps cropping up.
in The tales of Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow ...
it was there too.
- Where?
- Outside Gregorvitch's wandshop.
- What dors it mean?
- Look...
You have no idea where the next Horcrux is
, and neither I do
But this,
this means something.
- I am sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.
We ought to see Lovegood
Lets vote.
Those in favor.
are you still mad at him?
I am always mad at him
KEEP OFF THE
DIRIGIBLE PLUMS / i
Do not touch
Dirigible Plums.
What is it?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Hello, Mr. Lovegood.
I'm Harry Potter,
we met a few months ago.
Can we come in?
Where is Luna?
I don't know.
She will be along.
So...how can I
help you, Mr Potter ?
Well, actually ...
... it was about something that you were wearing
around your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
- You mean this?
- Yes.
That's it exactly
What I wonder is ...
what is it?
What is it?
Well.. its the sign of
the deathly hallows ofcourse .
- The What?
- The What?
The Deathly Hallows. I assume you are all
familiar with the tale of the three brothers?
- Yes.
- No.
I have it in here.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight
- Midnight.
Mom always said midnight.
Twilight is fine.
better actually.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight.
In time the brothers reached a
river too treacherous to pass
But they were learned in the magical arts
the three brothers simply waved their wands..
... and made a bridge.
Before they could cross however they
found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
It was Death
And he felt cheated
Cheated, because travelers
usually drowned in the river.
But Death was cunning.
he pretended to congratulate
the three brothers .on their magic..
... and said,
that each had earned a prize ...
... for being clever enough
to evade him
the oldest asked for a wand,
more powerful than any in existence
so death fashioned him a wand
from the elder tree that stood nearby
The second brother he decided
he wanted to humiliate death
even further..
... and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from
their graves
So Death picked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.
Finally, Death turned to
the third brother.
A humble man, asked for something
that allowed him to go from that place...
...without being followed
by death
And so it was that death reluctantly
handed over his own cloak of
invisibility
The first brother travelled
to a distant village...
... with the elder wand in his hand
he killed a wizard with whom he once had quarrels..
Drunk with the power that
the elder wand had given him..
... he bragged about it
You shall not prevail against his nose? ou.
But that night ...
...another wizard stole the wand
and slit the brothers throat for good measure.
And so the death took the first brother.
for his own
The second brother journeyed home,
where he took the stone and
turned it thrice in his hand
To his delight the girl he once
wanted to marry before her untimely death...
... appeared before him.
But soon she turned sad and cold
because she did not belong to the mortal world
Driven mad with hopeless longing
the second brother killed himself
so as to join her
And so death took the second brother
As for the third brother Death
searched for many years
but was never able to find him
only when he had attained a great age the
youngest brother shed the cloak of invisibilty
and gave it to his son ...
.. he then greeted death
as a old friend
and went with him gladly
departing this life as equals
so there we are
Those are the Deathly Hallows.
I'm sorry sir,
I still don't quite understand.
The Elder wand ...
... the most powerful wand
ever made.
The resurrection stone
The cloak of invisibility
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
Together they make one
master of death.
That mark was on the grave in
Godrics Hollow.
Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell
family have something to do with
the deathly hallows
Yes, Ignotus, and his brothers
Cadmus and Antioch were the original owner of the hallows ...
... and therefore inspiration for the story.
Your tea has gone cold
Don't go
I'll be right back?.
Let's get out of here .
I have more of this brndy pi? I will not.
- Thank you for ...
- You forgot the water.
- Water ?
- In the tea.
How silly of me.
You do not have to,
we should be going any way.
No, you do not!
Sir?
You are my only hope.
They were angry, you see,
because of what I've been writing.
so they took ...
... took my children.
my children
??
Who took her, sir?
Voldemort.
I got it!
treacherous little bleeder!
is there no one we can trust?
they kidnapped her
because he supported me.
He was just desperate.
I'll do the enchantments.
Hello beautiful.
Don;t just hang back
Snatch them
Harry.
Tell me. what to do Tell me, where it is. / I
Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
-??
-??
I knew
that one day you come.
But surely as you know.
i no longer have what you seek.
I believe you Grindelwald,
tell me where it is
Tell me who posseses it.
The elder wand lies with him
ofcourse....
Buried in the earth.
with Dumbledore.
The hallows exist
He is only after one... the last one
He knows where it is.
he's gonna have it by the end of the night?.
you know who's had the elder wand.
Do not touch her!
Your boyfriend will get much worse for that
if he doesn't learn to behave himself
And what happened to you, ugly?
No, not you.
- What is your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
Check it.
And you him and ugly, lovely?
What do they call you?
Penelope Clearwater
Half blood
There is no Vernon Dudley on here.
You hear that ugly?
This means you're lying to us.
- Why did not you tell us? Who you are?
- Do you have a mistake, I already told you who I am.
Change of plan.
We are not taking this lot to the Ministry.
Get Draco.
Well?
I can't be sure.
Look closely, son.
If we are the ones who
hand Potter to the Dark Lord....
... everything would be forgiven,
it would all be as it was understood ?
Now we won't be forgetting
who really caught him ...
...I hope Mr Malfoy.
- Don't dare to talk to me like that in my own house
- Lucius!
Do not be shy, come closer!
If this isn't who you
think it is Draco ...
... and we will call Him,
He'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure!
- Whats wrong with his face?
- Yes, what it wrong with his face?
We captured him like that.
Something he captured in the forrest I reckom
That happens during a stinging jinx
Was it you
Give me your wand, let's see
what your last spell was
And I? A.
Whats that?
Where did you get that from?
It was in her bag when we searched her
I reckon its mine now.
Are you mad?
Get out!...Get out!
Cissy ...
... hold those boys in the basement!
I'd like a conversation with this one...
... girl to girl!
What are we gonna do??
We can't leave Hermione alone with her!
Ron?

Luna?
The Sword is meant to be in my vault
How did you get it?
- Did you and your friend STEAL FROM MY VAULT?
-
I didn't take anything.
I do not believe you.

- There is no way out of here.
We tried everything.
It's enchanted

stairs in ten seconds.
Who gets his wand?
So once again, goblin
Think it very very carefully.

You don't know?
Please try again.
Who got into my vault?
Who stole it?
Who stole it?
Impossible to break into Gringotts
the sword is there.
Mudblood / i
How did it get here then?
Nowhere is safer,
than in Gringotts bank.
Consider yourself lucky goblin
- This does not apply to her.
