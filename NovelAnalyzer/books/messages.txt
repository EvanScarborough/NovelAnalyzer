budy: hi this is Vidya!
me: Hi Vidya! Glad to finally have your number!
me: Are you starting a GroupMe?
budy: yeah i will do that
budy: ok cool!
me: Awesome! Got it!
budy: do you have id numbers?
budy: mine seems to just be blank
me: I had to save before they showed up.
budy: ok cool! thanks
me: Hey Vidya! I think some of us (at least Emily, David, and me) are going to go out on State street later if you want to join us!
budy: down!
budy: are we just meeting at the plaza place?
me: Sweet! Yeah I think that’s the plan. Kinda late, so I don’t know how long we’re expecting to stay out or anything
budy: hmm yeah definitely on the later side
me: Yeah, a bit.... well, I guess we can try to rest before then....
budy: yeah see you later then!
budy: rest well
budy: i actually just had the weirdest experience, i thought i was hallucinating or something but then i realized they have lightning bugs here haha!
me: Hahaha sounds like a life changing experience! That’s exciting, I love lightning bugs! Where did you see them?
budy: very wondrous and life changing
budy: they were on the trail to the bus stop near my house
budy: i can appropriately use this emoji
budy: ✨
budy: the alt j song was deadcrush in case you wanted to know
budy: i was totally wrong
me: Haha somehow I totally didn’t see your text until now. I’m glad the name of the song came to you haha it’s a good one!
budy: are you guys still going to pride tomorrow?
me: Yeah! I think that’d be fun!
me: At least for a while: I don’t really know what you do at a pride parade.
budy: now that you mention it i’m not sure either
me: Yeah... no idea, but I think it should be fun! I can’t seem to find a map of the parade route... so I don’t know where we should meet!
budy: it looks like we won’t be coming down after all but i hope it’s fun!
me: Hey, do you know where we are supposed to go for kitchen duty?
budy: it says deep soace cumulus
me: Cool thanks!
me: Hmm... probably going to be late... Andrew took a long time getting up! Are you doing some sort of training?
budy: i haven’t found the checkin spot yet 
me: Hmm... if you find it let me know where it is!
budy: hmm ok i found some people
budy: it’s in the cloud room (cumulus supposedly)
budy: level 1
me: That’s a good sign! I’ll (hopefully) see you in a minute
budy: can’t find where you went
budy: are you still at deepspace
me: Yeah I guess I just got voluntold to do a new job
budy: voluntold is a good one
budy: im still in the cloud room
budy: all the rooms seem full and im not sure where to go
me: Yeah I’ve basically given up on going to that. Also probably not getting a lunch box either, I think they just forgot where I started lol
budy: where are you
budy: they actually said we just pick it up when they are giving it out in deep space
budy: are you going back to fomalhaut
me: Oh ok. I’m back down in the kitchen now
budy: Box Lunch Crew--



If you were mistakenly told there was lunch upstairs in Cumulus, that was incorrect. Sorry for the confusion!



There will be lunch for you down in the Deep Space A kitchen. I think it will be ready at about 11:30.



Thanks for your help today!
me: Ah ok. Do you know where that is? Honestly I don’t really feel like roast beef haha....
me: I’m done now, they let me go. I’m still in deep space
budy: yeah same
me: Where are you?
budy: ok im gonna come there
budy: in in roll i think
budy: not much space here
me: Ok! I’ll meet you at the cloud level where we started
budy: ok
me: Hey, what was the name of the better pdf editor you found?
budy: foxit
me: Cool thanks!
me: Hey Vidya! Quick question- what are your favorite things to do in Houston?
budy: hmm i guess it depends is it still rainy there?
me: Not right now, but it might be soon
budy: i guess i would recommend checking out the hermann park/museum district area: there are some free museums and it’s also nice to just walk around the park and lake, it’s also close to rice which is a nice place to walk around! if you do swing by rice you might enjoy visiting the turell skyspace which happens at sunset
budy: china town is nice too, the place with a lot of shops is called dun huang plaza
budy: also the menil collection and things in the montrose area are pretty nice!
budy: yeah if you have any specific things you are looking for let me know 
me: Thanks! That’s very helpful :)
me: I am flattered by your nomination hahaha
me: I am definitely an expert already
budy: definitely!
me: I’ll have to find a good one to add you to... It’s not really relevant but I think my favorite I’ve seen so far is “Matt Damon Movie Monday’s (Every Thursday)”
me: It looks like the Caboodle class was closed 😢 I emailed the trainers, but otherwise I’ll have to do it after STC
budy: really!? :o
budy: i just signed up in wednesday
budy: i’m sure they will add you though
me: I know! I guess they close them one week before? But yeah, hopefully.
me: Also... where did you find that weird audio-visual experience thing haha I was trying to find a website but couldn’t!
budy: https://www.facebook.com/events/252931842013363/?ti=ia
budy: here it is^
me: Hm. Yes looks very strange! I’d love to go!
budy: so i’m probably gonna try to make it to that event at like 8ish! my roommate might be coming so we shall see
budy: im just gonna leave it as is since she accepted 
budy: nicr
budy: nice
budy: just sent a meeting request! i guess you and david can do the other two
me: Cool, yeah I just set up the integrated areas one.
budy: ok cool!
budy: should i have requested an hour for foundation systems review?
me: Oh haha sorry I didn’t read your email first and set up the wrong one....
budy: haha no worries, wasn’t necessary 
me: Well, I don’t know. I figured the integrated areas one has to be an hour because we’re going over questions but the foundation one might be shorter since we already went through the questions.
me: Sweet, yeah I’ll aim for around then also! I will see you then and we can... sense some things?
budy: might be closer to 8:15-8:20
me: No problem! I might go pretty soon and see what’s up.
budy: ok cooool
budy: see you there
me: Actually I did the exact opposite of what I said. I’m leaving now!
budy: is it close to where you live?
budy: haha ok
me: Yup, says it’s like 6 minutes
me: Ok, I legitimately have no idea where I am lol
me: I think this is it...? But I’ll still wait for you to get here haha so let me know when you’re here!
me: Are you getting close?
budy: yup
budy: in car
budy: we are here finding parking 
budy: i think i’m going to buy tickets for tomorrow, are you still down?
me: Yeah! I’ll buy them too!
budy: ok cool
me: Hey! What time were you thinking on getting to The Majestic?
budy: i’m thinking of getting there around 7:15
budy: what are you thinking
me: Sounds good! I’ll aim for about that time too. Is Somya (? I don’t remember how to spell her name) coming too?
budy: so it seems i will probably be arriving at aroun 7:15-7:25 depending on how long it takes me to park
budy: she is not coming, and it’s sowmya (completely understandable haha)
me: That’s fine! Nobody is even playing until 8 anyway. Ok that’s fine, I asked Andrew but he’s busy. Oh! I was so close to typing in a ‘w’ but I figured I’d try to use as few letters as possible!
me: Alright! Made it! It’s pretty cool in here!
budy: ok cool im walking over
me: Cool, yeah no rush, it’s not very crowded yet
budy:  ok!
me: ok!
budy: yeah i may have accidentally parked a little far away
me: Oh no! Well, that’s ok!
budy: yo just sent some more stuff that we need to research to your email just fyi
me: Heh, yeah I just sent (two) new emails with one note things. Did you get those?
me: At least the most recent one?
budy: yup looks good 
me: Hey, do you have any idea what your default password was? I very much do not remember and don’t even remember what the sheet looked like....
me: Nevermind! Found it 👌
budy: ahh just saw
budy: glad you found it
me: Haha thanks! So you want to go to trivia? I’m going to try to get a table at like 7:30, so like any time between then and 8 would be a good time to get there!
budy: ok cool!
me: Cool! Yeah I just got there, if you walk in and go basically to the end if a the tables I am there! See you then!
budy: should be there soon 
me: Ok! No problem!
budy: hey i was just working on upgrades
budy: and i was wondering if this meeting is just gonna be mainly on our nft and usg meetings and the two tech notes
me: I think so...? I’m honestly not super sure but it does make it sound like that. I pulled up the two notes but now I don’t know if there’s anything else I can do to prepare haha
budy: i also noticed that on the wiki there is some scenario thing where we give a powerpoint which i did not notice before and was not listed anywhere else
budy: i’m not sure if we are meant to do that part or not but it says to present it to our tl?
budy: anyways tell me what you think regarding that
me: Hmmm... yeah you’re right... I think that the TL you present to is the “Tech notes TL” which would be Adam, not our actual TL. So... I dunno, it makes it sound like it’s different for our app. I think don’t do it either
me: Ok! We can just hope that we don’t totally fail this haha
me: It’s not a dumb question! I went to Emc2, chart searched for Tech note the typed in the number and they were there
me: Of course! :D
me: Parking?
budy: no i actually unregistered and will probably take it later but hope it goes well!
me: Oh! Cool. Yeah I should have done this later and done caboodle instead.
budy: figured out thunder!
me: Oh nice! What did you do?
budy: just sent!
me: Thanks! I just had like the most unproductive mentor meeting ever. A few weeks ago, Allie showed me Thunder and since it was the first time I created a password- but because she was watching I panicked and put in something without committing it to memory, so I couldn’t even use thunder hahah....
budy: oh no! i almost forgot where i recorded mine too
budy: totally normal
budy: did you get it though?
me: I had to reset the thunder one- which is ok since I don’t have any environments!
budy: ok that’s good you could do that!
me: I’m really impressed with your email haha honestly it should be copied onto wiki I think
budy: thanks! yeah couldn’t find it anywhere 
budy: this caboodle training is very boring yikes 
me: Oof yeah looking forward to it! SQL was fun, but Caboodle as a subject seems like it’d be pretty boring....
me: Lol I got 86 on the test👌
me: B’s get degrees
budy: was this mychart 
budy: because i got an 86 too!
budy: high five 
budy: yeah i think virtual classes are just inherently less engaging 
budy: also this is a customer class so it’s slower too
me: Oh yeah it was! High five, 86 squad! Maybe it’s rigged.
me: Yeah, that sounds boring... and it’s so long too! Do you do any exercises or anything at least?
budy: ￼nooo
me: Lmaoooo! Ok, but... I’m not sure what pun that is....
me: Bored intertwined arrows.
budy: shuffleboard 
budy: ￼
me: Lol sure....
me: Is that that colonial?
me: Lol that’s what me and David came up with haha
budy: eel on musk
budy: elon musk
budy: ￼
budy: he has three more
me: Yikes... hang in there.... all those foods start with c, is that something?
budy: seafood buffet 
me: That’s so dumb ugh 🤦‍♂️
me: Wow Vidya, this class looks really rough, I’m not sure if I can handle that
budy: he literally went over them for 15 minutes!
budy: oh well
budy: ￼this one was kinda good
budy: tic tac toe!
budy: also yes, i don’t think you can handle these
me: Wow haha fun stuff! I think those pun images are starting to brainwash you, that is definitely a pretty unsettling visual.
me: Yeah, oof, I guess I’m not getting that $2000 cuz I’m not going to be able to get past Caboodle :/ dang
me: It sounds fun to go out tonight! But... I honestly don’t really know, like, anything about Jesse-except that there are a lot of Jesse’s at Epic haha
budy: i was just gonna text you haha
me: Wow so in sync!
budy: anyways i don’t know anyone except jesse who is my mentor
budy: so you should come too!
budy: it’s mainly other mychart people i think
me: Haha ok, yeah, well, if you’re sure I’m still invited, then I’d love to!
me: Where and when should I be?
budy: it seems like around 9, i will let you know the specifics once i know
budy: and i think state street area!
me: Sweet! Yeah, let me know!
me: Any updates, Vidya? Other than *not* going on a rollercoaster, have you been up to anything today?
budy: i was just about to text you
budy: :o
budy: it seems like we are getting dinner first at 7, and then going bar hopping
budy: i don’t know if it makes sense for you to come to dinner since it might be a smaller group but i can let you know when we are headed elsewhere 
budy: haven’t been doing much though! did you do anything?
budy: i walked around willy street and i also watered my plants
me: Oh man! Maybe I can just subconsciously tell when you are about to text me.
me: Cool, so I am already getting dinner with Andrew, so that works out great! Just let me know
me: Cool, I went to the farmer’s market but other than that not much! Lol I’m glad you watered your plants. And neat! Was there anything cool on Willy Street? I haven’t really seen the shops there yet, just the fair I went to last weekend
budy: hey it looks like it’s a smaller thing than i thought 
budy: ahhh i feel so bad
budy: i’d say you can still come, we are still at the restaurant 
me: Hey! That’s ok! Haha well, I won’t come if you don’t think it’s appropriate, no harm done!
budy: ok cool, sorry again!
me: Yeah no problem! We can hang out some other time
me: I’m impressed you’ve already infiltrated Jesse’s inner circle of friends lol
me: How was bar hopping last night?
budy: sorry again about ditching :(
budy: it was good though! it was a little awkward because i didn’t know anyone and felt pretty out of place but it was good to meet them
budy: but yeah good overall! lol definitely not in the inner circle
me: Haha don’t worry! It’s totally fine! And that’s cool, yeah, it’s a little weird when you don’t know anyone, but I’m glad you got to meet people! Were they all MyChart TS? Anyone seem especially cool?
budy: yeah they all were mychart related people, and i did slightly know some people from my small team and allie but everyone was cool
budy: are you doing anything today?
me: Nice! Allie is cool too, though I can’t really imagine her going out bar hopping haha
me: I went to brunch this morning which was good, but now probably not doing anything. Maybe I’ll check out Curdfest. You know- when in Wisconsin, right? But I’m not sure. You doing anything today?
budy: ooh curdfest
budy: no nothing in particular, i think sowmya wanted to go to that actually 
me: Haha might as well: it’s a good opportunity to learn about the local culture. Also it’s literally 1 block away from my apartment. Would you and Sowmya want to meet me there? Or is there something you’d rather do?
budy: ok cool! we are thinking of leaving at around 3, and will let you know when we are there
budy: curdfest sounds like a very good educational opportunity
me: Cool see you in a bit! And yes, I’ll probably bring something to take notes on ;) learn about the storied history of curd culture, you know?
budy: we are parked and walking over
me: Ok! Rad! I’ll be there in a bit
budy: we are waiting at the entrance at patterson and washington corner
budy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_light
budy: it’s not magic anymore
me: Methylene Chloride, huh? Toxic AND carcinogenic? Vidya! This ruins all that was once magical in my world! Oh well... at least it looks pretty, I guess.
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: you have to face the facts in this day and age
me: I guess my childish sense of wonder had to be killed off at some point. Thank you for enlightening me haha
me: ￼Oh NO.
budy: hahaa
budy: now you’ll be super good
budy: we haven’t done any “fun” things yet :_(
me: Oh :( that’s so sad! Here- I’ll share the fun with you:
me: ￼
budy: poison ivy!
budy: got that one
budy: that was an easy one!
me: Yeah it was easy... that was the only one i took a picture of :/ here was a better one, let me see if I can find it!
me: Hmm... these are hard to find. I’ll draw it lol
me: ￼Lol beautiful 20 second drawing
budy: very beautiful
budy: hmmm
me: I hope I drew it well enough for it to be recognizable.... probably not though. This one was in color too so my drawing is at a disadvantage.
me: Need a hint?
budy: did you guys start walking 
budy: yes to the hint
me: Nope, we are leaving homer now! Where are you?
me: And haha the first drawing is of a specific plant. It’s an herb. The herb’s name is in the pun!
budy: we are started walking 
budy: around juno now
me: Did you finish class for the day?
budy: yeah just finishing the exercise now
me: Hey I totally forgot that I was going to send you a list of song recommendations! The “math rock” band I was telling you about is Everything Everything. They’re pretty unusual, so my favorite songs of theirs have changed over time. At first, my favorites were “Get To Heaven,” “To the Blade,” “Can’t Do,” and “Spring/Summer/Winter/Dread.” As I got more familiar with their style, I think the best ones are “My Kz, Ur Bf” and “Cough Cough.” The last two are definitely the best representative of what makes them so unique as a band, and they both are very interesting to try to analyze for what they mean. But yeah, pretty weird band, definitely no chill whatsoever so they might not totally be your style, and that’s ok! Just thought I’d share! 👌
budy: are you done with it?
me: Yup! Now I’m not sure what to do.
budy: did you setup the dlg
me: No, I thought our guy said we didn’t have to do that for this exercise. Did you?
budy: yeah i don’t think we need to
budy: i’m not sure what to do though 
budy: are you just sitting or can we go
me: Lol me neither! I just went back to my office, but I’ll probably leave pretty soon.
budy: cool! i’ll definitely check out those thanks for writing it out!
budy: i’ll let you know what i think
me: Cool! Yeah, kind of unusual, you won’t offend me if you don’t like them haha! If you have any recommendations, always feel free; I love hearing new stuff!
budy: yes i will definitely try to recommend something at some point!
me: Do you want to play my game? Do main^X28658PLAY in fndexb 👌
budy: whaaat you made a game?
me: It’s really silly and dumb, the workbook does something similar too haha
budy: i will definitely try it
budy: very nice
budy: what’s your best score
budy: also do we have to make this for class
me: I made the score global, so I think it’s 6 now haha and no, I was bored after class yesterday
budy: seems like the weathers not bad so i can come!
budy: let me know if it’s still on 
me: Awesome! We’re gonna get first this time I can feel it 🔥 I will see you around 8 at the Shamrock bar and grill!
budy: ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
me: This is serious stuff Vidya! We’re going to win it all! ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ    (ง'̀-'́)ง
Trivia geniuses!
me: Oh also if Sowmya wants to come too she is welcome :)
budy: walking over!
me: Sounds good!
me: You’re going to make me cheat by looking at my phone!
budy: ￼
me: Hmmm... I have no idea I feel like “stage hand” doesn’t work cuz those are clearly paws...
me: They’re dog hands tho
budy: you’re on the right track 
me: Hmm... ok, I recruited Emily’s help so we will think about it for a minute haha
me: Ok I have no idea! What is it?
budy: dramatic pause
budy: not a great one
me: Oh my god 🤦‍♂️ hahah yeah there’s no way I was going to get that!
budy: i think you were close!
me: Your office is always crowded, looks like you’re famous too, Vidya Giri.
budy: 😎
me: Hey! Play my new game!
d main^X28657FUNSTUFF
me: It’s hard to see still, I need to figure out how to write a filled square.
budy: wow i love FUNSTUFF
budy: im unable to open it
me: Oh oops I typed my number wrong!
me: d main^X28658FUNSTUFF
me: Lol
budy: ok cook
budy: cool
budy: im unable to solve it aaah
budy: this is cool though!
me: It’s always possible: I wrote a graph traversal algorithm to check any point would be cut off. It’s just hard to seeeee :(
budy: we just got let out
me: Wow really? I think we still have a ways to go!
budy: hmm you’ll have to help me solve this one later if i dont get it
budy: what in the world is a graph traversal algorithm
me: Hey it was nice hanging out- talking about The Wiggles at 1 a.m. completely sober was not exactly what I envisioned, but you know, still good!
budy: this is not funstuff this is fancyfunstuff
me: So as far as kayaking- we should try to do it in the morning-ish since it looks like that’s when the sun will be out. Maybe like 10 or 11? From the terrace? I’ll look up how rentals work right now!
me: Oh yeah you can press q to quit also
me: But it is possible!
me: Specifically the algorithm is a Breadth First Search, basically it’s like when you use the paint bucket tool in photoshop or something- it will tell if two points are connected
me: Very fancy 👌
me: You guys are done? Are you going to lunch?
budy: im in my office rn and am getting pretty hungry
budy: but i’ll wait until you guys are headed over 
me: Ok! Well, I have no idea how long that will be, so if you get too hungry, I won’t be *too* offended if you go without us ;) but otherwise I’ll let you know!
budy: ok!
me: I found a weird character that makes the maze a little more readable I think. Try it again? Maybe I’ve just been staring at it too long so I’ve lost perspective. Also it reminded me of a corn maze so I added some lore.
me: Ok we’re done now! Meet in Cass?
budy: sure
budy: ￼i found my dad!
me: Isn’t it an amazing, heart-wrenching story? People come for the FUNSTUFF, but stay for the plot.
me: Hey! I’m sad it’s going to be cold this weekend, I really wanted to go kayaking or something :/ (maybe we can still do stand up paddle-boarding but we just have to be really good and not get wet?) We could still do six flags this weekend though?
budy: ￼it is sunnier on saturday than the other days!
budy: yeah i’m probably still down for either!
me: Yeah, but still pretty cold. I mean, I’d still be down to kayak in the cold if you went too!
me: Oh! You use Celsius! I’m uncultured so I don’t know just how warm or cold those are :/
budy: yeah i think it shouldn’t be too bad (hopefully!)
budy: celsius is great!
budy: i switch back and forth between the two a lot
budy: but honestly we should probably all start using kelvin instead, it would be waaaay easier to tell how warm it was
budy: like wow it’s 290K today,  so far from absolute zero!
me: Awesome! Yeah either would be fun! Maybe we should try to plan on kayaking? We might not get another chance unless “ice kayaking” is a thing. Does that sound good?
me: And I think you’re right! Wow, it’s 273? That’s balmy!
me: Maybe I should do that too: set my phone to metric. Like, I always say the metric system is so much better but I guess that makes me a poser
budy: yes that sounds great (on saturday right?)
budy: the metric system is definitely better for some things
me: Yup! Saturday looks better
me: Remind me... where all have you lived? Presumably the places outside the US used metric?
budy: i lived in jakarta, indonesia and bangkok, thailand
budy: and yes haha they use metric pretty much everywhere except here
budy: yeah!
budy: i think maybe brittingham boats/monona might be easier in terms of parking and accessibility 
budy: just because saturday is crowded due to football and stuff around uw area!
budy: and the water would be calmer too
me: Yeah, it looks like the memorial union one might be closed anyway…. Thats a good call about the game too!
budy: oh no!
budy: it looks like it closed sept 23rd
me: So… oh yeah, thats what I was about to say :(
me: So… oh yeah, thats what I was about to say :(
me: The one that looks potentially a little more promising is Olbtich Park, but that’s way on the far side of the lake from you.
budy: down if it is open!
me: Ok, cool, yeah I *think* it’s open. But I’ve been wrong before :/
budy: september 3rd :(
me: It looks like it’s 7 days a week until sept 3, then it’s just weekends until the end of September.
me: But it’s not super clear....
me: It is possible we missed out opportunity though :(
budy: oh i see
budy: it’s worth a shot!
me: So... Yeah! How about we plan on that, but, like if that’s no good, we can go on a bike ride instead around the lake? I’ve wanted to do that too!
budy: that sounds really fun too! where do you get bikes
me: They have a bunch of automated bike rental stations around the city, so those can’t possibly be closed!
budy: ok that sounds like a plan!
me: Excellent! Meet at... lets say 10:30? At Olbrich Park?
budy: ok cool!
budy: see you then, looks like i better get to sleep faster then!
me: Haha you’re right... maybe 11:30 would be better?
budy: hmm 
me: What time do you think it’s hard to say
budy: i’m fine w either
budy: lets do 10:30
me: Maybe yeah 10:30 sounds good
budy: ok!
budy: rad
me: 11:30 is too close to lunch so it gets awkward
me: Ok rad
budy: way too awkward
me: Haha like awkward timing wise!
me: Either way, better get to bed! I will see you tomorrow Vidya Giri?.
budy: (^ᴗ^)ノ
budy: https://youtu.be/gsH_oUaFmas
budy: here’s that video i was talking about
me: Hahaha that’s great! I’m always amazed at how people will go so far out of their way for silly things like this! The little eyes are a nice touch too
me: Also your emoticon guy is adorable, you’re an expert haha
budy: can we push back a little to 10:45
budy: also: get.shrugsterapp.com
budy: best investment you will ever make ◕‿◕
me: That’s fine! (^ᴗ^)ノ
budy: i couldn’t find my keys so i’m running later than 10:45 just heads up
budy: but i found them
budy: so leaving now
me: Oh me too! Not about losing my keys but being late. That’s ok! It’s good to, like, say 10:30 because it accounts for probably being late haha
me: Looks like it’s still open! ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
budy: our bikes may be due in 5 minutes
me: Hey I’ll meet you in the entryway to my building!
budy: im not good at parallel parking 😢
budy: this jodel app is really interesting!
budy: so many epic things and also a lot of people trying to play jackbox remotely (?)
budy: hey! yesterday was super fun and i’m glad we were able to do so much
budy: i think i’m gonna head out now so i guess see you later
me: I haven’t looked too much at it- I’ve been waiting to go to Epic! Wow really? I might not be seeing the same ones as you. Remote Jackbox sounds like it kinda defeats the purpose... how does that work anyway?
me: Have you done anything exciting today?
budy: hmmm i’m not entirely sure 
budy: but yeah i guess i might be close enough to epic compared to what you would s e
budy: *see
budy: no didn’t do much, just went to the grocery store and cleaned and made food
budy: did you do anything today?
budy: (definitely not as eventful as yesterday)
me: Hmmm well, if it actually works it would be fun. Yeah you might be close enough!
me: Did you water your plants? Yeah I really didn’t do anything haha definitely not as eventful as yesterday.
budy: yes! i did do water my plants and had a mighty swell time with it too
budy: did do is a new phrase i am trying to coin in case you were wondering and is definitely not a typo
me: I like that! I also did do like how you never capitalize anything. Capital letters were invented by the societal elite to make people believe that some letters are inherently more valuable and powerful than others... probably. I have to water my plant tomorrow and I just know it’s going to be radical
me: Also, I just wanted to say thanks for a fun day yesterday. Maybe I’ve been feeling kind of like I shouldn’t be here. But... yesterday (and today since we were up until like 5:30!) was fun and it makes me feel a little more at home to have such a good friend. So thanks! You are a good friend and I appreciate you haha
budy: say no to capitalization!!!
budy: i’m excited for you, definitely seems like it will be radical
me: And yeah I’m sure it’ll be a party, feel free to stop by lol
budy: i feel the exact same way, it’s was nice to just hang with you as it has definitely been tough moving to a new place but yeah i’m glad to know you! you are very cool and it’s good to know i have a solid friend
budy: and yes! looking forward to it
budy: maybe you can make it a naming ceremony if you come up with one!
me: I’m glad :) I always have fun with you- I’ll definitely listen to Whethan over the next few days and it would be fun to go to the concert Thursday!
me: And that’s a good idea! Maybe I’ll come up with a list of ideas and we can choose one
me: (They’ll probably all be ironically horrible plant names)
budy: ooh yeah! i guess i’ll try to buy them later this week then
budy: when you buy from box office you don’t have the service fees right?
budy: as for plant names i’ll brainstorm a few potential ideas as well to help ya out
me: Yeah I think it is cheaper to buy from the box office, but can you only do that the night of the concert? They might be sold out.
me: And thanks! Haha I’m sure we can come up with a super clever (or stupid) name!
budy: chlorophil
me: Hahaha that’s great! The best I could think of was calling it Willow Jr but that would be funnier if it looked more like a willow tree
budy: aww willow jr
budy: chlorophil is short for chlorophyllis
me: Oops looks like we were charged the extra $3 for the bikes... oh well... it was well worth it!
budy: i just got that text tio
budy: too
me: That’s funny that they text us! I’m going to go back to my office soon and make a name tag for Chlorophyllip. We can put it on him (or her?) if you stop by later :)
budy: yeah! i’m so ready, just got back so just let me know 
me: Ok! Sorry I guess you texted so fast that I didn’t even see it.... but I made a name tag!
me: I think getting dinner from Cass is definitely the move👌
me: So I’ve been listening to Whethan, I think it would be really cool to go! Should we get tickets? Do you think that if I walked across the street I’d be able to buy tickets from the box office?
budy: definitely! very high quality :)
budy: ooh yeah let’s go!
budy: i looked it up online and it seems like the box office should be open if they have a show in the night
budy: i guess if it’s not too difficult i can pay you back!
budy: ￼
budy: definitely would save a good $8
me: Oh! I was actually just about to text you- I just walked across the street and yes, you can indeed buy tickets! I got us tickets- they were $22.50 each which is not bad. That’s like $11  cheaper than on the website. Is that ok? Sorry I was just going to surprise you haha
budy: yeah that’s awesome! i’ll  venmo you
budy: lol also walking back with davis and jason was ridiculous
budy: they are unreal
me: I really look forward to going! Haha that they most certainly areeeee.... what did he do?
budy: jason said he forgot his laptop at home and was drawing pictures of bread all day???
budy: and he had app camp but was drawing bread (?)
me: Lmao? Haha that kid
me: He’s funny, but also kind of acts like he’s so much smarter than everyone lol
me: I really wonder what their family was like haha
budy: yeah i’m always confused by him ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: definitely 
me: Yeah very odd! Did he show you any of his bread drawings?
me: Also I still have no idea whose umbrellas those were lol
budy: yeah they were definitely breads!
budy: lol haha
me: That’s insane hahaha I mean, bread is interesting- and as we are all well aware, there are many different kinds- but I’m not sure I could just draw bread for an entire day honestly. When I get bored in class I like to draw maps. It’s good because they’re basically just random squiggles!
budy: that’s pretty interesting! do you mark them up in any way or are they usually forms? i guess you’re right that they are random squiggles but sounds very cool indeed 
me: ￼I usually don’t get far enough to add features, more just things I can do mindlessly like shading around the edges. This was from CLN! I like to imagine how the geography might shape the people who live there haha it’s kinda silly
budy: that’s so cool! i like the shape of it and how it has the little edge
budy: it looks like there are a lot of exciting places in this world
budy: i’m sure the people who live there are 100% satisfied!
budy: (or at least 99.99% satisfied because you can’t please everyone)
me: Yeah, there’s always some stickler who can find something wrong with paradise but that’s to be expected ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I know you like drawing giraffes! I also really liked your squid guy and the landscapes in your little sketchbook too! I think you’re very talented. Do you have a favorite thing to doodle?
budy: thanks! i guess similar to you and maps my go-to doodles of the moment are tree branches or these specific shape designs 
budy: googly eyed squid and giraffes are very fun too of course
me: That’s cool. I’d like to see what these specific shape designs look like! Also can you draw a giraffe on my whiteboard?
me: Oof this is pretty boring
me: Lookitt>k me
budy: yeah!
budy: 💀
budy: i think i am gonna work in the barn bridge for a while if you wanted to also come!
me: Cool, yeah I will go with you!
budy: random but do you know if there’s any good way to do multiple lines (like !5 instead of !!!!!) sorta like how we do ? for spaces
me: Hey! Hmm, yeah I was wondering that too. You can use a for loop but that’s obviously not as convenient.
budy:  yeah i was thinking of writing a function to add lines with a for loop
budy: thanks!
me: Of course! It’s good we didn’t do trivia last night- I kinda got home and almost immediately fell asleep 👌
budy: i did the exact same pretty much!
budy: sleepy tuesdays i guess
me: Haha yeah I’m sure it had nothing to do with staying up until 5:15 am the other night. But I feel less tired now!
budy: yeah...nothing to do with that
budy: totally worth it though!
me: One of the best nights in recent memory, slightly more exciting than last night where I slept for like 10 hours
me: Looks like we’re going all the way to noon today! Is your class taking longer too?
me: Wait actually we are done!
budy: we are walking now!
budy: 10 hours wooow!
budy: ￼it was real???
me: Lol yes sorry for confusing you it was indeed real! Trump has your number.
budy: 😱
budy: are we supposed to go the round table thing today? are you going?
me: I have no idea honestly.
me: I forgot it was a thing until now.
budy: consensus seems to be no
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ oh well
me: What is that supposed to be anyway?
budy: from what i have garnered it seems to be a place to bring our customer issues? i guess another resource with other newbies?
budy: ???
budy: idk
budy: so i figured out why we are starting at 11 tomorrow
budy: we are supposed to do the whole ch 4 before then haha
me: Ok interesting... I don’t know anything about my customer except that it used to be Lauren’s and it is Pittsburg. So I guess that’s not relevant!
me: Oh wow haha
me: That’s rough! The entire chapter is self study? Hmm. Well, honestly I haven’t been paying much attention in class so it all feels like self study anyway.
budy: yeah! pretty much
budy: also they did recommend to take the exams in whatever order
budy: so i might also do 2 first
budy: (maybe)
me: Well cool. I wonder why yours is self-study but mine isn’t. Weird.
me: And yeah, that’s good to confirm! But it still seems so weird to swap them
me: Not sure I can get on board
budy: yeah...
budy: seems suspicious
budy: some interesting statistics:
budy: https://shared.jodel.com/8AuR4Za3IQ
me: Lmao that’s so funny! I hope to one day try every one of these flavors.
me: I wonder where they got this data? This is very important to me.
budy: very important.
me: Have you posted anything on Jodel yet? I keep forgetting.
me: (Also I don’t really know what I’d say)
budy: not yet! just lurking
budy: i’ll try at some point!
budy: it’s pretty funny how active it is though i had no idea 
me: Yeah it’s fun! I used to post a lot of yaks when that was cool like 4 years ago.
me: I think I need to set my hometown to Verona, I think I’m missing the Epic stuff. UW Madison is not very active compared to Mines!
budy: what were your best yaks?
budy: mine says madison at my home but i guess i still get all the verona ones
budy: definitely not getting any uw over here
me: I don’t even remember anymore... Yik Yak like totally died after my freshman year! So it’s been a while. I just remember I had a ton of Yakarma!
me: I just reset my hometown to Verona so now I can see Epic stuff from anywhere! You’re right, Epic is very active haha
me: This changes everything! Try:
d writeBig^X28658EM(“HI”)
budy: oooh
budy: idk im writing it wrong but getting syntax error 
me: It totally stopped working! I have no idea why :( that’s so sad! This changes nothing actually.
budy: oh no i probably broke it sorry 
me: Yeah how dare you?
me: Jk I probably shouldn’t have been messing with that anyway haha
me: All it did was print bigger text
budy: ooh you can do that :o
me: You COULD but then you went and broke it ;)
me: I’ll see if I can figure it out later. I should probably study tho
budy: 😢sometimes you just break things
budy: haha yeah DO YOUR WORK WORK
me: 😭It wasn’t your fault I didn’t mean it!! Yeah I’m doing WORK WORK now.
budy: hey are you checked off for foundation systems 
me: Hmm let me check!
me: Nope! I only have upgrades/tech notes and integrated areas checked off
budy: ok i might email amy then thanks!
me: Yeah that’s probably good. Do you have the roles one checked off?
budy: yes
me: Hm. Is that one that your TL checks off on? I guess I’ll remind him.
budy: idk my tl was the section reviewer for that one so im not entirely sure
me: 🤔hmmm I’ll just ask him
budy: i’m heading over! we’ll see how parking goes
me: Cool! Let me know how that goes! We can figure something out!
budy: found something but im so bad at parking 
budy: might take some time 
me: I have faith in you!
me: Do you want me to help direct you?
budy: got it!
me: Proud of you!
me: Are you near my apartment? I will be in the lobby!
budy: ok walking there
budy: made it home!
me: Hey :) I’m glad! I was just texting you (so I’m sync)! Just wanted to say thanks for hanging out with me tonight! I guess we weren’t 100% invested in the Thursday night EDM thing but I still thought it was really cool (and the lights were so pretty *•*)! So yeah, I had a good time with you, I hope you did too!
budy: yeah it was so fun! thanks again for the ~amazing~fun~ time!!! 
budy: basically i’m a salad now
me: Yes! You’re a good salad. Lots of beets and pistachios haha
me: Gonna be a little later than 7:45, traffic was not too good :(
budy: lol same 
me: ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
me: As long as we’re both late haha
budy: where are you sitting 
me: I’m all the way at the back all the way on the right side (looking at the stage)
me: Where are you?
me: I saw Sowmya
budy: me and lucas are front middle
budy: well front of back section
budy: front of back muddle section
me: Oh, you look so tired! I’m sorry :c
budy: oh no is it that apparent?
budy: i feel more awake then before
budy: hope you are doing ok too!
me: You’ve been closing your eyes haha I don’t think anyone is paying attention though
me: That’s good you feel better! I’m doing fine! :D
budy: how’s life on the other side of the building?
me: It’s so lonely being a 20 second walk away from your side 😢 This is definitely the better side though. It’s sunnier and I can see a treehouse! How is life on the North Side?
budy: i agree with you, zodiac is definitely not as exciting and there are some dramatic rain clouds in the distance...
me: Yeah, I tell people I’m from the South Suburbs of Fomalhaut. Oh that’s no good.... well, I won’t even be in my apartment if it floods again. Maybe you should just swap with Jerry then people will know where he is and you get to look at the forest! You’d have to be with me though so it’s a trade off
budy: the forest might be enough to compensate for that but just barely
budy: yeah it’s gonna be a rainy weekend if the weather is accurate (although i don’t trust it)
me: ￼Saucy and cheesy 👌
Are you having a nice evening of grocery shopping?
budy: oooh looks so good!
budy: VERY SAUCY AND CHEESY
budy: i haven’t gone yet unfortunately so maybe it will be a tomorrow thing
budy: do you recommend that pizza?
budy: and how’s CHICAGO?
me: It was top notch 👌 Andrew said it was good but that he likes a different place better haha but I would definitely recommend. Then we went to a movie (Andrew loves movies).
me: Oh well, the grocery store is 24-7, I guess you can just go at 3am tonight.
me: Chicago is good! Tomorrow I’ll really see more of it so I’ll let you know more then
me: If you didn’t go shopping, did you find anything fun to do?
budy: he does seem to like movies! which one was it?
budy: i didn’t go to the grocery store at 3 am but maybe that is something that should happen at some point
budy: and nope i just chilled at home! i think me and sowmya might do something today so we shall see
me: He likes them very much! It was “A Star is Born” the one with Lady Gaga. It was really good! Pretty sad. I cried but I cry at most movies heh
me: Three am grocery store needs to happen sometime but that’s ok that you didn’t go last night haha honestly I was pretty tired, just chilling sounded very nice!
me: And that would be fun to something with Sowmya! She asked if I wanted to go to a pumpkin patch this morning. Are you going to do that?
budy: it was sad? aww 😭 i don’t cry at movies often but it might happen sometimes
budy: i can’t think of an exact one i last cried at
budy: we ate lunch at ha long bay which was really nice! we are gonna have to do pumpkin patch /corn maze at some point as it would definitely seems like her main interest
budy: we also drove to the sassy cow creamery and got ice cream (sooo good!) which is where epic gets it’s choccy milk actually
me: Maybe I get too invested in movies sometimes. Maybe I can be sappy but I prefer to think I’m empathetic¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: I’ve never gone to ha long bay but I’ve heard good things! I’ll have to go. And yeah, we will do some spooky stuff with corn mazes and haunted houses for sure! I’m glad Sowmya is excited about all that too!
me: Sassy cow is awesome that sounds like a lot of fun! They have good ice cream and top tier choccy👌
me: ￼Oh my god Andrew and his mom are SO FUNNY together they kill me! He calls her “Tina” and they somehow, like, “Who’s on First?” off of each other and they go on like that for so long! It’s too much haha we went to see the bean and to a fancy Italian restaurant (he also likes fancy Italian food) but we got some fancy desert whose name I’ve forgotten (pic related) but yeah it was a fun day, did a lot! How was your roommate day?
me: (Wow sorry for the hella long text!)
budy: nah empathy is definitely a good thing to have
budy: that does sound funny and fancy and sounds like you’re having a good time in chicago
budy: i definitely cannot tell what that is except that it’s a fancy dessert! but looks good
budy: honestly haven’t done too much else but it’s been nice
budy: also i had to search up who’s on first and i don’t totally get it but i’m assuming you mean the general quippy tone?
me: Yeah it’s been fun, Chicago is pretty cool. But yeah, sometimes a weekend of just not really doing much is very nice! So sounds like you’re having a good weekend too!
me: Haha I guess the joke of it is that one of the players is named “Who” (or Hu? Not sure) and so everyone is confused. Andrew and his mom are kinda like that where they argue a lot but don’t realize they’re arguing the same thing
me: Also Andrew has a very cute little dog, it’s been a long time since I’ve gotten to play with a dog so that’s nice!
me: On our way back to Madison now, how are things in the capital of America’s Dairyland at present?
budy: sounds like a fun time!
budy: things are alright, and i actually made a random soup today in honor of the soup season
budy: also since you asked about the dairyland, i actually learned that 90% of wisconsin milk is made into cheese
budy: so there’s a fun fact to think about on your way back!
budy: we are in the back left of rattle/roll
me: Y’all’re gonna have to give me the sparknotes version haha I didn’t think it was worth it if we’re leaving early so I will not be attending :/
budy: smart!
me: My customer has a call tomorrow at noon and they want me to introduce myself. I told Lauren that I have a class, but she kept prying to see if I could still stop in for a bit and so I told her that lunch is supposed to be at noon. So... now my tragically short lunch break is even shorter 😢
budy: nooo that’s so sad
budy: yeah i had to cancel my caboodle exam too and am taking it next week instead because of my transition
me: Ugh. Customers are so inconvenient. We should just do training permanently.
me: What was your Oregon customer again? I have one in Oregon too it looks like!
budy: oregon health and science university
budy: what is yours?
me: That’s cool! I actually have a friend who does research at Oregon health and science. She says she loves Epic haha Mine is Legacy Health, also in Portland and decently big
budy: yay portland 
budy: are you still here?
budy: ￼it’s his birthday!
me: Lmao I know I saw that! What are we doing to celebrate?
budy: suprise party? 🎉🎊🎂
me: Yay! I think that’s a good idea. First we have to randomly run into him and say “Kenton Whitmire? In the flesh?!”
budy: sounds like a plan >:D
me: I think Facebook thinks Kenton is like my best friend, he always shows up first in the list of stories.
budy: this talk about temperature scales woaah
me: Haha I think my phone is still on Celsius, but I wish it were Kelvin.
me: I forgot about trivia again! Oh well... we have early exams anyway. But if we were good friends we would have invited Kenton to do trivia with us
budy: definitely 
budy: so just a heads up but i wasn’t feeling ready for the exam so i cancelled it and will be taking it next week instead
me: Ok, yeah I don’t blame you, I was up until like midnight... I’ll still go for it and I will... let you know how that goes....
me: *nervous laughter*
budy: you can do it!
me: ☀️☀️☀️
budy: but yeah just wanted to let you know!
budy: 💫💫💫
me: I appreciate your vote of confidence! But yeah, it’s a little crazy to do it now, I figured I’d still see what it was like anyway
budy: ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
me: Lmao so that was way easier than I was anticipating: it took 35 minutes and I got a 98
me: ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
budy: aww man nice!
budy: good job 
budy: i bet it’s because you studied really hard too
me: I mean, that did help. I don’t know how STC2 is but if it’s like STC1, you would have been fine I think
budy: aww man
budy: his name is phineas
budy: and he works on mychart in the haut :o
budy: what if he heard us???
me: Wow that’s honestly exactly the name I would have given him.
me: Oh no! Maybe he’s on to us! That’s amazing though! No wonder we see him all the time!
me: I guess we need those pictures.... Do you want to go do a quick photo shoot with the giraffes in Deneb?
budy: yeah we def need those!
me: Cool! I’m at lunch right now with Lloyd, if you join us we can take pictures after
budy: okeh, let me know if you guys leave
budy: just lloyd?
me: Okeh, no I’m with Emily and David and Lucas too
me: But Lloyd is my favorite.
budy: are there any good gelato flavors today?
me: I only saw that there’s a captain crunch one which is interesting
me: I’ll have to check the others!
budy: ￼took you to constellation instead of The Constellation
budy: my bad
me: We might actually be leaving soon but we can go back for gelato and pictures!
me: Hahaha that’s ok, I got to hang out with you for seven extra minutes! Thank you for driving me! Sorry for making you drive extra though.
budy: no worries!
me: Back in the haut, let me know if you want to go
budy: no problem! always a fun time with you and it really wasn’t very far
budy: don’t want you to freeze!!!
budy: haha im free now but totally understand if you are busy!
budy: we should go to the museums at some point
budy: can always do it another day!
budy: it looks like the university one (chazen) closes at 5 though on friday at least
budy: ￼￼￼￼￼￼
me: Haha well, I appreciate you looking out for my well-being
me: We definitely should! I guess not this Friday, but we can find a time soon...
budy: definitely!
me: ￼￼Are you today’s date because you’re looking 10/10! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I didn’t take as many as you did but here you go
me: I guess the next few weekends will be filled with visitors but we will still hang out and have other people around to do stuff with too
budy: woah it is 10/10
budy: thanks!
budy: yeah definitely!
budy: we have a solid list of things to do now so that’s good!
me: I have no idea what to put for where people could find me outside of work...
budy: like play that board game that we almost played, or go to the kollege klub again, or devils lake which is cool but not that cool apparently
me: Haha yeah doesn’t live up to Marika’s high standards. I’d still like to see it! And of course go to Chicken Lips on the way back
me: Also visiting Milwaukee and getting deep dish in Chicago, going back to Emily’s favorite coffee shop, and ice fishing when it gets cold!
budy: hmm
budy: i don’t know either 
me: We should be able to fill a few weekends
budy: that snow thing is crazy!
me: Oh also spooky stuff!
me: I’m tempted to give some non-answer like “I’m never in the same place twice”
budy: so much to do!!! 
me: And yeah it’s crazy! It’s gonna start here soon too :( I like snow but not if I’m driving in it
budy: i’m very excited, you’re a fun person!
budy: definitely should do devils lake and chicken lips one weekend before it snows!
budy: does it actually say it’s gonna snow next week 😱
budy: but also spooky stuff and your birthday too!
me: Heh... nevermind I was in playground link not project!
me: I don’t think it will snow until the start of November probably (knock on wood)
budy: i think i will come after all!
me: Ok cool! I look forward to seeing you there!
me: But like.... this project sucks.
budy: you can do it!!!
me: I’m not sure.... For the last part with healthy planet, I don’t think the correct dashboard even exists in CertA....
budy: hmm idk i did in cert b
me: Wait... it’s no in either. Do you remember how you added the 51113 report thing? I’m not even looking in the right master file....
budy: hmm i’m not sure i remember but i probably made a note of it on my paper
budy: which is on my desk agh
budy: i’ll check the companion tho just got home
me: Haha so you’re suggesting I steal stuff from your office? ;)
me: Jk but yeah I have no idea. Isn’t it in Radar on the Template?
budy: ya im p sure
me: But like that’s not working at all :(
me: Oh well, I have to leave if I’m going to get to Emily’s dinner
me: I’ll just wing it on the test heh....
budy: did you add it to your security points?
me: Add healthy planet? I think so. But like I looked in Chronicles even and couldn’t find it in the dashboards
budy: hmm i guess we can review it tomorrow morning?
budy: i’m not sure of most of what i side haha
budy: *did not side
me: Haha well, yeah maybe I should have actually looked at the webinar screen  every now and again instead of doing the debugging exercise.
me: I’m on my way, prolly be a minute late though, I’m just walking
budy: im almost there!
budy: to great dane
me: Aw, I always have fun when I’m with you :)
me: Definitely! I’m sure we can find some time to do that before it snows. Maybe this Friday we could do board games?
budy: Liked “I vote next Friday night!”
budy: yes we should try to do that?
budy: that!
budy: we are in cass btw
budy: lol worried for link now
me: Yeah! We should! I can bring it up in the group.
me: How was the test? I’m curious!
me: My guess is that you passed
budy: yeh!
budy: 92
me: You’re the worst 👌
budy: i just really took my time 
me: Nice job!
budy: thanks!
me: I don’t think I know what epiccare link is or does.
budy: but yes you should bring it up
budy: what even is an epiccare link
me: I guess Emily changed her mind on the haunted house- would you rather do board games or a haunted house tomorrow?
budy: im fine w either!
budy: i think haunted wood be fun!
budy: i’m cool with tomorrow too!
budy: we should do it!
me: Yeah I think that’d be good- we can do board games in the winter but only haunted forests in spooky season
budy: yeaaah
me: Is that like “yeaaah!” or more like “yeaaah, about that...”?
budy: it’s so cold today compared to yesterday!
budy: woah in sync
me: Woah that was weird!
me: Simultaneous texting!
budy: !
me: And yeah it’s really cold :(
me: Looks like we’re sorta settled at this temperature for a while, but don’t worry it’ll get colder.
budy: the place i’m going to is right across the street from the constellation 
me: Is it constellation, or THE constellation? ;)
me: That’s cool! What place is it?
budy: the!
budy: bo’s meadery 
budy: i hope there are people 😱
me: Haha that would be awkward... well, if you get tired of all those Rice people, I can come hang out with you across the street!
budy: yeah!!
budy: it’s right next to the sylvrr
budy: sylvee
me: Cool! A meadery sounds very fun and interesting. Are you there now? What time is the event?
budy: yes just got here!
budy: you should come!
budy: if you want of c
me: Ok! Yeah that’d be fun!
me: If it’s ok that a non-rice person witnesses this secret meeting
me: I’ll stop by at least! Be there in a minute!
budy: cool!
budy: glad you came and hung out with us owls hehe!
budy: sorry for distracting you from stc though!
budy: i think we will come and pick you guys up downtown and then go to schusters from there
budy: it seems the farm is on the east side
budy: so picking you guys up would be on the way
budy: 
me: I see now that it was all an elaborate ruse to slow my progress in STC!
me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA pumpkin seeds go in pumpkins not on the ground 😂
budy: sorry for the late reply! yeah we are at a farm!
budy: yeah i think we will just pick you up!
budy: how’s your day so far?
me: But yeah! It was fun! I liked seeing your owl friends and Carlos seems cool
budy: ￼pumpkin seeds ON THE GROUND 
me: That sounds fun!
me: He laughs a lot at dumb jokes too so that must be a Houston thing
me: I’ve basically not really been doing anything today
budy: i know it’s hilarious!
budy: lazy sundays are nice
budy: i got a pumpkin so we have to carve them at some point
budy: what time did we agree on?
me: Not as funny as pumpkin seeds on a couch but it’s up there!
me: Yeah! Yesterday was pretty busy so I don’t feel too guilty about having a lazy day today
budy: also where do you live again emily i always forget
me: Definitely! Maybe we can carve pumpkins someday after work this week? That’d be fun!
me: Are you doing anything else today?
budy: hi @lucas
me: I’m drinking some hot cider tho so that’s an exciting day :D
budy: looks like you caught onto my evil plan!
budy: yeah they were fun
budy: i didn’t know carlos super well at rice but did work with him a few times
budy: also hey! my sense of humor is great!!!
budy: i like hella cold °C.
budy: also nice groupme pic, you didn’t have one before right?
me: I fell right into your trap!
me: Haha I appreciate your sense of humor, but it is established that you laugh at really dumb jokes
me: Which is a good thing! People should laugh more I think
budy: so we are thinking of leaving around 7:45ish to get there 8:15-8:30?
me: How did Carlos know ... was her name Gabby? I forgot. I couldn’t tell how they knew each other!
budy: (from our house on the west side)
me: And I’m glad you liked my dumb joke and my picture! I haven’t had a picture taken of me in a while so I figured I’d use that one!
me: It’s from the famed photographer, Vidya Giri ;)
budy: people should laugh more! but i probably am not the best example
budy: i don’t actually know how they knew each other... but maybe through bissy and because they started in july (?)
budy: or carlos’s roommate?
budy: idk
budy: so famous 
budy: almost as famous as THE evan scarborough IN THE FLESH!
budy: actually not almost but maybe one day
budy: Liked “I guess we can figure out a better carpool system tomorrow if we have more people too”
me: I think you’re a good example! I laugh a lot too but I laugh quietly. I should be more open.
me: Either way, they were all cool! It’s funny to meet a trainer! She is basically exactly how I’d expect a trainer to be!
me: One day you’ll get to that level where people stop you in the hallways.
me: I think you’ve got what it takes to be a star
me: Also you used capital letters!?! That’s crazy!
budy: O P E N
me: Not sure what that means! But I guess as long as it’s just for emphasis it’s allowed.
budy: CAPITAL LETTERS
me: Maybe you should do only capitals from now on. That’d be even crazier.
me: YOU’D SOUND SO INTENSE, VIDYA GIRI!
budy: I THINK PEOPLE WOULD JUST THINK I WAS ANGRY ALL THE TIME
me: Jeez, it was just a joke! No need to yell at me 😰
budy: I AM SORRY THIS IS MY LIFE NOW
budy: Emphasized “OMG SOMETHING SOCIAL WITH LUCAS?????”
me: Did you somehow turn off capitalization? Like how it automatically capitalizes after a period? Or do you press the shift button off every time? That would be a lot of commitment.
budy: yeah i turned it off!
me: Just to be unique?
budy: I GUESS SO
me: Haha don’t be so mad! I think it’s cool! I mean, I intentionally never match my socks. That’s kinda the same thing!
budy: THEY NEED A SETTING FOR ONLY CAPITALS
me: I KNOW! APPLE IS RACIST AGAINST LOUD PEOPLE!
budy: how’s inbasket
me: I’m not really paying attention at all. I’m studying for the STC test instead. I learn these things better as self-study anyway. How is Clarity?
budy: cool!
budy: are you taking it today?
budy: going good!
me: Yup I’m still going to try to take it today. We will see how that goes!
me: Does Clarity have good fun stuff? The trainer of this webinar isn’t even doing anything!
budy: ￼
me: Hmm... Best Western?
budy: yeah!
me: Oh too good! Classic Monday Punday. I want to see someone show niceonedad haha
me: Already done! But it’s gonna take me like 20 minutes to get back before I can check my score haha
budy: woah awesome!
me: 94% pretty good!
budy: i bet you did great 👍 
budy: oh wow!
budy: nice
me: It DID have a lot of really specific stuff but not too bad
budy: congrats!!
me: Wow thanks for the confetti ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
me: Now to email Nick. I REALLY just want to be done with Link!
budy: yeah good luck!
budy: do we really not have to do inbasket?
budy: also do you know how long the quiz is for that? did they say
budy: and the project?
me: So in sync! I was just about to text you! I’m really confused now. I’m going to look into it.
me: I definitely didn’t pay attention to class at all so I don’t know how long the project is.
me: I don’t even remember why I was signed up!
budy: it’s under link/mychart ts curriculum!
budy: but a lot of stuff under there seems old/not maintained
me: Yeah it’s definitely in there- I have parts of it marked off now.
me: But maybe that isn’t required, just strongly encouraged?????
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I didn’t pay attention so I didn’t waste any time
budy: perfecto
budy: im feeling very tired aaaah
me: Oh no! Yeah I’m losing motivation too :/
me: I’m sure once you get home you’ll start feeling all ready for some spooky forests!
me: But yeah, an all day Friday class sounds rough :(
me: ￼Here’s a picture of a fat raccoon. I have a lot of awkward animal pics I guess
budy: very nice!!!!
budy: it’s so round!!!
budy: i appreciate that a lot!
me: I thought you might! It’s a good picture. Very high quality.
me: So David is not going, Lucas is still deciding, I guess we could still stick with the original carpooling plan?
budy: yeah let’s stick with it!
me: Ok! I’ll figure out where Emily lives and meet you there at... maybe like 8? How long does it take for you to get downtown from your apartment?
budy: we can pick each of guys up from your respective places
me: Ok, I mean, if that’s inconvenient I can just walk to Emily’s place too. Let me know!
budy: should be fine!
budy: does this work: me and sowmya will leave at 7:45 and go and pick up evan and emily from their respective places
me: Ok sounds good!
budy: lucas do you think you will be coming?
budy: then we should be able to get to the place by 8:45
budy: coooool
me: Everything ok? I tried to set up outlook on my phone again but it still didn’t work :( I’m sad
budy: oh no!
budy: don’t be sad look at this:
budy: ￼
budy: i’m doing ok though! are you?
me: Oh my gosh! Whose cat is that! Looks so cozy! ◕o◕
me: Im doing good too! I just wasn’t sure if your “cooool” was like an actually not cool thing.
me: Everyone knows an even number of o’s is good but an odd number is like everything is not cool actually ;)
budy: just a cat from the internet! but isn't it so cozy! very good for distracting from outlook troubles :)
budy:  we are on the way!
budy: ~20-25 mins
budy: nah i actually say cooool all the time
budy: i guess i need to put more work into crafting my messages since i send too many messages and do not pay attention to the number of oooos
me: Wow well it’s still a very nice cat. I want to get a cat! I miss animals.
me: Ok that time you put an even number of o’s
me: You text amazingly fast! I always feel worried that you’ll text me before I finish typing.
me: But yeah, it’s important! I try to be expressive through writing which can be hard.
me: ￼Oh here’s a good one!
budy: we here
me: One sec!
budy: that is a good one
budy: lil mashpototto
budy: we are circling let me know when you’re ready 
me: Ok I’m outside!
budy: ok we coming there 
budy: we are a little back
budy: across the yoga studio 
budy: right behind edjones
budy: we are 6 mins away!
budy: we are here!
budy: wait right there
budy: ￼we got apple cider @lucas
me: I had fun tonight! It was a little cold maybe but really fun overall! I honestly liked keeping you safe from a bunch of monsters haha I hope you had fun too even if you had your eyes closed for some of it ;)
budy: it was fun! thanks for protecting me i definitely would not have made it without you so i am super grateful!
budy: you make a very good human shield hehehe
budy: yeah just a normal blink, just sliiiiightly longer
budy: it was fun though! i just am a scaredy cat aaah
me: Oh ok it was just a long blink. That makes sense! Haha I’ll gladly be your human shield whenever you need one
me: I’m glad you had fun, scaredy cat! It’s best to go with someone who actually does get scared
me: I’m to brave obviously haha
me: (*too, oops) but I’m flattered you trust me to be your human shield haha
budy: well i’m very grateful as you did a great job! very brave!
budy: also i’m proud of us for braving the cold too!
budy: also send me the raccoon roll!
me: ￼Haha what a silly raccoon! He has forgotten his proper method of ambulation.
me: I think I’ll go to breakfast pretty soon. And by breakfast I mean the farmer’s market
me: Are your friends on their way? I’ll probably just let you be with them but if we bump into each other that’d be cool too
budy: yeah! i will be heading there at ~11-11:15!
budy: desperately cleaning aaah
me: Oof yeah that’s a bit rough having that many guests!
me: I’m sure they aren’t expecting a five star hotel
budy: ￼found while cleaning!
me: Haha I can’t believe it! Those hands are so small, I assumed it was gone forever!
me: Was it only one?
me: I got some apple cider! It distinctly says cider on it!
budy: ooh
budy: farmers market? im here now maybe i should get some!
me: Yeah! So it’s the real deal 👌
me: Oh there’s a place with apple sauce and apple butter too!
me: They’re all the same thing tho obviously
budy: ok i’ll have to find it!
budy: ill also return your lego mans hand at one point
me: You found both hands?
budy: no but i’ve only had one for a very long time!
budy: whatchu up to today?
me: Well, you can keep it haha
me: I think you know all of my plans actually. Did you decide on something to do with your friends?
budy: we are at the capitol now and going to tipsy cow for lunch in a bit!
budy: just wandering around here you are welcome to join if you want!
me: Cool! Well, I just walked back to my apartment, but you can let me know when you are about to go to lunch and maybe I’ll join you!
me: I might not be hungry at all tho since I just had breakfast haha
budy: ok!
budy: heading there now feel free to drop in! we are also gonna hangout/ walk around later!
budy: maybe terrace
budy: i’ll let you know!
me: Ok cool, maybe I will let you just have lunch with your friends but I would love to hangout/walk around with you all later!
me: Is that ok?
budy: yeah definitely!
me: Ok cool! Well let me know what you guys do after lunch and I’ll meet you then!
budy: we are still finishing up eating and will be heading over to the terrace afterwards!
budy: i’ll let you know when we are walking there but if you can’t make it we will also see you later!
me: Sounds good! Yeah let me know and I will meet you there!
budy: yay ok we are gonna start heading over!
budy: are you gonna walk?
me: Yup! I’m just gonna walk so I’ll probably get there like 10 minutes later than you do
me: But I am on my way :)
budy: yay! i think we are stopping for coffee real quick so you might even beat us/catch up
me: Yay! Sounds good! See ya soon!
budy: we are just leaving colectivo (at the square)
me: Ok I haven’t reached the square yet so you’ll probably beat me if you go straight there
budy: we will probably walk slow
budy: via state
me: Ok well I will walk quick
me: Via state
budy: lol we are stopped at the state historic museum 
me: There’s a state historic museum? I just passed short stack
budy: yup we are just entering state!
me: You’re going very slow then! Well should I go back or meet you at the terrace?
budy: ahh we coming!
budy: just at short stack
me: Ok my phone might die so I will by by the big chair where we saw pikachu haha
budy: ok
me: Take your time though!
budy: ok walk slower!
me: That’s ok! I was expecting you’d go slow
budy: almost there hopefully!
me: Really, take your time! Haha
me: Hey are you guys still coming? Just curious! It’d be fun to hang out with you
budy: it seems we will not be :(
budy: :(
budy: everyone’s tired aaah and i think we want to do things in the morning 
me: Oh no! Your friends don’t like us :(
me: Jk
me: That’s fair!
budy: it was fun though!!!
me: Yeah! It was cool 👌
budy: we just live too far out lol
me: What are you doing tomorrow? Any set plans yet?
me: Yeah that makes sense :/
me: Well, when it gets cold we can hang out at your apartment haha
budy: yeeaaah!
budy: i’ll let you know currently considering options
budy: but probably a farm!
budy: are you at their apartment?
me: Yup, I’m at their apartment and a lil drunk already. But a farm sounds so fun!
budy: sounds like you’re having fun!
me: Haha I’d be having more fun if you were here
budy: next time! we have more fun in the future in store!
me: What are you up to Vidya? I look forward to all the fun in store
me: Hey! Yesterday was fun! We didn’t really do a whole lot after the brewery, basically just drank more haha
me: Are you guys going to a farm and stuff today?
budy: yeah we should do it! it would be super fun!
budy: but is it real apple cider???
budy: no they left around 4 and now i’m just sitting around!
me: Yeah for sure! We can bring it up tomorrow at lunch (I guess it’s box lunches for staff meeting, huh?)
me: Yes! It is the real deal! Hot apple juice with spices and stuff!
me: Did you have fun with your friends? They all seemed cool!
me: Also it might snow tonight :(
budy: wooaah ~staff meeting~
budy: sounds like some good cider! yeah it was super fun to see them this weekend
budy: i just checked that and that’s crazy!
budy: i have not bought my scraper or whatever snow clearer things i need for my car yet
budy: so hopefully not too much!!! aah but im excited!
me: Yah pretty good stuff 👌 I need to get some cinnamon sticks for the cider too then it’d be even better!
me: That’s cool that your friends could come! I’m historically not very good at keeping in touch with friends so I don’t know if I’ll really see my college friends much more :/ they definitely won’t visit I don’t think, but they all live in Denver so maybe I’ll see them when I go back
me: I know it’s crazy! It probably won’t accumulate if it does snow, but we can make some big snowmen later (And some tiny Huston ones too)!
me: Also I’ll check tomorrow, I think I do have multiple ice scrapers.
budy: i’ve kinda lost touch with many high school friends too so i totally get it, but i think there are always chances to reconnect somehow! i should probably be better about doing it but i always find it hard to keep in touch via message and try to call when i actually want to talk to someone
budy: and also it’s always nice/better when meeting up in person
budy: yes we should make some cool snowmen!
budy: i still got some time left so i’ll have to see what else i need to buy for cold prep 
me: Yeah, it’s definitely best to talk to someone in person, so that makes it hard. My oldest friend who I still talk to is a girl I’ve known since Kindergarten and now she does research at Oregon Health and Science University, your customer! Funny how that happens, huh?
me: Do you have an oldest friend like that? You moved a lot, so that might make it harder too.
me: And yeah, you’ll be ok! I think even I need better snow stuff even though Denver got 5 inches today....
me: Haha the C# companion uses the XCH cheese master file
budy: really!? that’s pretty awesome!
budy: and cheeeeezy
budy: also regarding your friend at ohsu that’s such a coincidence woah! and it’s great to have friends like that
me: Very cheeeeezy! Except it’s not really workin too good, I need to install something and it’s not working :( no cheese for me
me: And yeah it’s super weird! I have a customer in Portland too so we can both say hi to her if we travel haha
me: Who is your oldest friend you still talk to?
me: Oh also do you want to do trivia tomorrow?
budy: i guess i have some family friends that i’ve known for a while and still keep in touch with but yeah didn’t really keep in touch with my friends from elementary school 
budy: unfortunately, i probably am gonna have to pass this week to review a little for stc
budy: but i willing try to see where i’m at tomorrow
budy: *will
budy: also i’m trying to learn blender to finish my bubble picture
me: That’s ok. Yeah, I was up pretty late for STC too. I know you’ll be able to do it- you’re very smart!
me: I’d love to see your bubble picture, and it’s cool that you are learning a new skill for that! You’ll have to show me how to blend stuff sometime.
me: Is there sometime this week that would be best so we can still do pumpkins?
me: Hey, and also, I know this is dumb but I was too busy acting like nothing phases me to say it before: even with your eyes closed it was brave to go to a haunted forest, like, I remember that I was pretty worried when I went to a haunted house the first time. I admire how you’re always willing to try new things and I think people could learn a lot from you, myself included. So, just wanted you to know that!
budy: i’m off to some sort of start with blender, definitely not a pro at all but hopefully i figure it out tomorrow, i’ve always wanted to learn it and it’s pretty fun
budy: hmm what do you think of wednesday after work? i don’t have any exams on thursday so it works for me
budy: also thanks! i don’t think it was that much of a big deal as i had you to guide me through haha and i definitely wasn’t looking for most of it even though it probably wasn’t that scary. i think i’m just scared of being scared
budy: but i do like to try things at least once if i think it could be something worthwhile! i feel like otherwise i would never know
budy: i feel like i admire that about you too! like going to an edm-y concert on a thursday night＼(^-^)／
budy: ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ
budy: ^unrelated but i just saw this on my keyboard and it was appropriately spoopy
me: ʕ•̫͡•ʔ wow! It’s a cute little ghosty boi! I also admire your ability to make text emoji-y things! Like, seriously what keyboard has these? ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
me: I’ve always wanted to learn how to do 3D modeling, like, I thought SolidWorks was super fun haha (did you have to do any cad stuff like that?)
me: But like I always thought it seemed cool but sometimes there’s something valuable about the limits of 2D art and animation themselves.
me: Haha well it was pretty spooky, I would have been perfectly happy letting Sowmya go first but I guess The Patriarchy made me go first instead ;)
me: But yeah, it’s good to try new things. Sometimes you like them, sometimes not too much, but like that’s ok! I feel like it’s ok to do things you don’t like if it means finding others you do. I’d prefer that over always just doing the same thing over and over!
me: Also is that $8 for beer? You really don’t have to, but thanks anyway! I still owe Sowmya a drink from two Fridays ago, you just reminded me :o
budy: do you understand all these emails we are getting?
me: About the security escalation for Link?
me: If so, I don’t think I’ll ever even support Link haha so I think I got off easy 👌
budy: i see
me: Sorry :(
budy: i think the tc deals with it so should be fine
budy: what are you up to?
me: I am in Lauren’s office on a call with UPMC. Basically I’m completely not helpful or relevant so that’s cool
budy: you will be one day!
budy: do you know if we have to do anything for broken watchouts
me: ☀️☀️☀️
me: I have no idea what those are actually.
me: What’s a broken watchout?
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Did you get an email about those?
budy: yeah it was just for one customer and i just marked the fix to send 
me: How was the Clarity test?
me: Someone just stopped by my office just to say they liked my giraffe drawing haha
me: Hey! You’re still welcome to join for trivia! It’s ok if you’re busy but I’d love for for you to be there if you have the time!
me: Oh wait... Andrew texted that everyone had a rough day and doesn’t want to go tonight...
me: So you’re uninvited :/
me: But, I mean, if you want to do something else I’m sure we could find something else fun to do! ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
budy: thanks for letting me know! i’m not feeling very well so i’m gonna rest
budy: another day!
me: Oh no! I’m sorry to hear that :( 
me: Yeah, another time for sure, but try to get some rest for now
me: Not sure I can be too helpful but if there’s anything that would help, you can let me know!
budy: lol actually do you know how many sick days we get?
me: Haha aww, you’re feeling that bad? :c
me: It looks like we get 6 days per year, but I don’t know if that’s different since we are new
budy: ok thanks evan!
me: Of course! Just let me know if I can help with anything, ok?
budy: thanks! what are you up to tonight?
me: Well, I was working on my M game, but then I started wondering if that was a giant waste of time, so now I’m not really doing anything at all ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
me: So not much! Are you well enough to be doing anything?
budy: well the m game was great so far! i am definitely a huge fan of it! (but totally understandable to change paths with it)
budy: i’m eating some soup and trying to rest
budy: i feel fine but also tired so i’m gonna probably sleep early and study in the morning and see if i still want to take the exam
budy: but i might just cancel idk
budy: also i greatly appreciate useless talents, you never know when they come in handy and regardless they can be fun!
me: Haha I’m glad you liked it! Well, I’ll try to still finish it, but I’m just wondering, like, will anyone even see it?
me: I’ve made many things that nobody even sees so at a certain point you have to wonder, like, why? What can I make that someone will appreciate? I’m glad you appreciate it :)
me: Eating soup is good! Did you make the soup? Would David be proud of it?
me: And yeah, totally understandable to cancel it, the exam is not worth making you tired and miserable!
me: Honestly, it’s weird, I’m always happiest when I’m making something, even if I know nobody will ever even see it. Is that pointless?
me: How are you feeling, Vid?
budy: i’m feeling better! thanks for asking 
budy: cancelled the exam but coming in
me: So I do have a TL meeting at 11:30. Looks like David does too and I think Emily might be busy so we might not have a long lunch today. I’ll still get you something, but no guarantee on it being warm still just a heads up!
me: ￼Paneer curry
me: ￼Cheese grits with poached egg
me: ￼Apple slaw
me: ￼Patty melt
me: ￼Veggie Shepard’s pie
me: ￼Chicken stir fry!
me: Also soup. Maybe good if you’re sick still!
budy: just saw this
budy: if it’s too late no worries
budy: and i dont mind if cold
me: Not too late! Don’t worry!
budy: what did you get
me: I got the stir fry, it’s pretty good, I’d like it spicer tho 🔥
budy: i think i’ll take the patty melt thanks evan!
budy: it all looks p good
budy: i’ll buy you lunch tomorrow!
me: Of course :)
me: Oh! You’re not in your office! Do you want me to leave it in your office or I can find you if you’re nearby?
budy: yeah i’m on a call, you can leave it
budy: thanks!
me: Ok! You’re welcome
budy: just got a new webex meeting request at 12:30 so won’t be coming to the link meeting so you’ll have to let me know how it goes
me: Oh no! You’re too important! Ok well have fun with your WebEx, I’ll definitely let you know how it goes. From what I’ve heard it might not be especially relevant haha
me: Was your sandwich good? Hopefully not too cold!
me: Yeah that meeting was not super relevant. Krista is fun tho, it was weather themed so some of them had umbrellas while presenting haha
budy: thanks again for getting me lunch! it is super appreciated!
budy: also the pics were a nice touch!
budy: i see! yeah she seems really fun
me: Of course! I probably looked weird taking pics of each meal but that’s ok!
me: Would you still like to do pumpkin carving sometime? I didn’t want to commit to today since you’re still feeling tired. We could still do today or just find another time? Up to you! Then we can ask the others
budy: lol thanks again for getting me lunch it was super helpful and thoughtful of you to get the pictures too! i am very grateful
budy: and responding to some earlier messages:
it was chicken noodle and pretty bland but pretty good for something i hastily threw together (no cream or potato so david probably wouldn’t like)
budy: and i also find that i am happiest when making things, i don’t really understand why most of the time but it’s cool you feel the same way too
me: Haha of course! I’m always happy to help :)
me: Well, I’m sure your soup was a lot better than I could’ve made! And yeah, it probably wasn’t white enough for David, but that’s ok!
me: Yeah I really can’t explain it either, but it’s just satisfying!
me: I think that we have a lot in common, and I think that’s really neat! Even sometimes just silly details like having a lego keychain haha I’d love to make something with you sometime haha
me: I just always get tired of watching a show or playing a game or reading a book and would rather be making one!
me: Speaking of, how is Blender?
budy: yeah it’s pretty cool that we have so much in common with you and we should definitely make stuff together (or even adjacently) some time
budy: i guess we start with the pumpkins and see how that goes 
budy: 🎃 
budy: it’s going ok, although haven’t done much since i’ve been sick, but am gonna try to finish it by the weekend
budy: so you can do color in text????
budy: ￼looks like theres a whole xgame framework? woaaah
me: Yeah, this is fascinating! Notice how it doesn’t scroll down with each frame also haha!
me: I stalked the guy on guru- looks like he worked here from 2009-2011, then left for two years and came back in 2013
budy: interesting...
budy: i didn’t notice the nonscroll down but that’s crazy 
me: Well, Epic Monsters is gonna be so much better ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: I need to stop looking at this now I’m not getting anything done haha
budy: so distracting!
budy: ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ
me: ￼I figured out the logins finally!
budy: wow!
budy: im just imagining that monocled-corgi hacking upmc now
budy: unrelated but on the drive home i just saw a cars license plate that was xch
budy: the cheese masterfile!
budy: and the other day i saw a license plate that was zew
budy: lookitt!!!
budy: (sowmya was very done w me at that)
me: He’s not a good boy. He just installed randomware on their system and is holding it until they pay him 100 Dogecoin
me: Haha that’s incredible!
me: Although it is a sign that Epic is brainwashing you to see INI’s everywhere.
me: Are your initials INIs?
me: Mine are not, and that makes me sad :(
me: ￼Also here’s a good picture that reminded me of you
budy: i think he deserves his 100 dogecoin! he is very  smart
budy: epic is definitely brainwashing me :/
budy: my initials are not inis
budy: also i have no middle name so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: where did you see that pic? another one handed lego person!? woah
me: Owww Coco makes me cry every time
me: 😢
me: Yeah he’s a good boy even if he is a nutritious hacker
me: I don’t think Sowmya saw me cry tho so it’s ok.
me: I lost Davis when he went to find his brother so it was just me and your roommate haha
me: Also a lot of little kids, you could hear babbling throughout the whole movie!
me: You don’t have a middle name? So your full name is Vidya Giri? That’s interesting! It’s a good name I think. Do you have to put VXG for your initials on things?
me: I was looking through the pictures on my phone and I had that saved from like a year ago haha it’s one of my favorites along with Lego Bob Ross
budy: nutritious hacker? haha don’t you mean nutritious snacker??
budy: sounds like a fun time though, did they use all the screens?
budy: yeah i’ve been doing vxg for the projects
budy: lego bob ross? how cool!
budy: lego scissor stripe guy is cool too though
budy: this is random but did you know there’s a chalkboard on the kitchen downstairs?
budy: i don’t know where the chalk is though!
me: Oh yeah! I’ve seen that! It’s pretty cool. What is written on it now? Last I saw it had suggestions for weekend trips
me: I didn’t think to look for chalk! But now that you mention it, I don’t know where it is either!
budy: i got home and ate and now i just want to sleep aaah 💀
budy: trying to channel the bubble motivation
me: Oh no! I believe in your bubble making ambition! Would it be more appealing if it were coupled with the prospect of hanging out and doing non-work work together?
budy: that could be fun if you are interested
budy: looking for some places that are open late
budy: also sowmya is down for pumpkin carving! do you think others would be interested?
me: Cool! Yeah I think it’d be fun! Yeah I’m not sure what would be a good place for that.
me: Neat! Yeah we could ask others if they want to do pumpkin carving too! Up to you!
me: They might be too busy playing fork knife
budy: yeah might do sencha tea bar! they have wifi and are open until midnight
me: Oh cool 👌 get some bubble tea to inspire your bubble art?
me: That’s brilliant!
me: Let me know when you are heading over and I can meet you there!
budy: woah i didn’t even think of that! ok sure thing!
budy: and if you are tired totally understandable
me: Bubbles! Don’t worry, I’m not tired at all! Now I’m excited for some bubble tea
budy: ok cool well i’ll let you know!
budy: im here!
budy: it’s actually a lively night??
me: Cool! I’m on my way, may be like 15 minutes!
budy: may have left my wallet at home😱
budy: i’m checking my car
me: Oh jeez! That’s no good... well, I mean I can get you tea haha
me: And I won’t tell anyone you drove without a license
budy: yeah you may have to spot me if that’s ok
budy: i awkwardly already ordered and he made it and i said i would quickly go look for it
budy: so i will just try to wait here until you’re close yikes
me: Did you find it?
budy: no
me: Haha that’s ok! Ok well I’ll try to get there quickly!
budy: ok lol sorry im terrible 
me: Why do I put up with you? ;)
me: Almost there!
me: Hey, I enjoyed distracting you from drawing bubbles tonight! Didn’t get much work done but it was still a good use of a Friday night. Also I thought all of your videos and drawings were so amazing! You’re so talented ◕‿◕ So thanks for hanging out! I look forward to carving pumpkins and putting their seeds on your couch
budy: made it home and to bed safely 😰
budy: a wild ride for sure! saw an unusual amount of cop cars and was SCARED
me: Oh! I’m glad you made it without being detected!
budy: but i’m glad you came out! we shall have to attempt again but i had fun regardless you are so talented with your rule defying games!
budy: i definitely look forward to tomorrow!
me: Yeah haha we can try to be more focused. And for sure! I’ll be sure to get a good pumpkin and some tools!
me: Hey! Sorry I guess I felt obligated to take Andrew home but it would have been fun to stay out with you longer if you wanted to!
budy: yes! well i’m super glad we hung out! it’s always fun to hear what you have made and how your cool creations work
budy: also i don’t know many people who would willingly do “work” on a friday but i’m happy that it was somewhat enjoyable
budy: yeah i kinda was thinking it coulda been fun but today was super fun anyways!
budy: ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ
budy: glad we could make pumpkin carving a reality!
me: Aw well, I’m super glad we hung out too! And yeah haha most people would probably think we were weird for doing “work” on a Friday but it was fun!
budy: thanks for bringing the tools, cider and games
me: I wasn’t anticipating doing much real work anyway haha
budy: also you need rest for your 5am call!!!
me: ʕ•̫͡•ʔ BOO! ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
me: Yeah! It’s still so early! Sorry, I should’ve brought it up.
budy: so excited for baked pumpkin seeds on a couch!!!!
budy: did andrew wear his costume?
budy: hmm we could definitely roast the seeds
me: Haha ok yeah you might be right
budy: and maybe bake something with the non-seed guts
budy: https://eatingrichly.com/how-to-cook-a-whole-pumpkin-and-recipe-for-pumpkin-gut-bread/
me: He just got out of his room haha lets see!
budy: also sorry on my end, i should have driven you guys home since it’s so cooold
me: I drew him a little planet to put on his shirt
budy: aww cute
me: Oh we parked near short stack that’s why I had to go with Andrew!
me: So don’t worry!
me: But yeah, I’m glad we got to make pumpkins! I loved your little ghost guy! So cute! ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
budy: i loved your face!
me: Hey I guess a bunch of people are coming now haha do you need help with anything or need me to get anything?
budy: everyone’s turned out super well!
budy: haha what a big event!
me: ￼Lmao! Sorry it’s blurry it was a secret photo
me: Hmm yeah I don’t know what’s there either. Worth exploring sometime tho I think!
me: And yes, we’ll show everyone just how funny it is!
budy: woaah that’s actually really good!!
me: Yeah actually pretty accurate haha
me: Ya seriously even Lucas!
budy: ok i won’t tell anyone
me: And yeah all the pumpkins were good!
budy: we got him this time!
me: Ok good haha
me: Are you doing anything else tonight or just going home and chilling?
budy: sowmya’s getting stuff so it should be fine
budy: no i don’t think so
budy: are you doing anything?
me: No haha me neither. I feel kinda disappointed!
budy: ya this snow is crazy!!!
budy: oh no!
budy: she seems super excited it’s gonna be fun!
budy: we missed out a guess
me: I know! I’m not mentally ready for it to be snowing.
budy: *i guess
budy: what could we have done? the possibilities were endless
me: This is probably already about the most snow you’ve ever seen haha
me: Yeah :/ well, I mean, just as a thought, is there any bar or other sort of thing near you that’s worth going to? There’s already been a lot of driving back and forth today but I’d gladly go back! Or we could watch Coco haha
budy: it is
budy: in this 10 minutes it’s already gotten pretty thick
budy: hmm i don’t know much around here 
budy: probably honestly isn’t worth it
budy: i definitely want to watch coco but haha you just watched it!
me: Yeah I noticed that when I saw the snow over my interview: it accumulates really fast!
me: And coco is so good I’d happily watch it any time! I honestly would
budy: well i guess that’s what we should have done instead of parting ways!
budy: well that’s alright, i’ll definitely watch at some point 
budy: ￼
me: Yeah :/ I’m no good at making plans. I’m sorry.
me: Well it was still fun to carve pumpkins today! And yeah you’ll have to see it at some point, you can let me know and I’d gladly watch it again haha
me: It goes like zero to sixty
budy: no i think you’re alright! plans are hard to arrange
budy: i actually think it has been relatively smooth and easy to plan things with you which i appreciate 
budy: giraffe is confused 
budy: honestly i’m pretty tired tonight so might read myself to sleep 😴
budy: are you planning anything for tomorrow?
me: Well, thanks :) most of the plans I’ve made in recent years were with someone who needs everything to be very carefully scheduled out, so I really appreciate how you are flexible! It’s easy to make plans with you
me: Aw! Is this your giraffes first time seeing snow?
me: That sounds pretty good honestly! I am kinda tired now
me: And nope! No plans yet! Did you have anything in mind? We could go to the museum if you want!
me: That’s so cute!
me: I don’t know what to expect from UPMC which is annoying!
budy: hmm that could be cool to see the museum but understandable that you’re on call, i guess maybe the afternoonish could work?
budy: but we can do another weekend too
me: I’m excited to see your giraffes
budy: i was looking at freakfest and it seems pretty neat! only $10 but it’s seems like downtown halloween bars + some concerts
budy: are your parents coming the whole weekend?
me: Yeah! I think we could for sure do that in the afternoonish! I’ll just take my computer with me I guess.
me: I don’t know if they’ll really call me at 5 but in a way that’d be nice to get it over with.
me: And yeah! I think that freakfest would be amazing to go to! It’s a very Madison thing!
me: My parents will be here for the whole weekend 😐 like it’s cool that they’re visiting but sorta not a great weekend, I’m sure it’ll be kinda crazy! We can probably still do freakfest stuff though. They probably won’t do anything too late anyway
me: Hey we are here!
budy: coming 
me: At the entrance sorta near the playground
me: Hey we just got here! You guys close?
budy: yeah we walking
budy: how’s it looking 
budy: how’s it goingp
budy: oops going
budy: did they call at 5am? also if it’s too much hassle to carry your laptop today than we can do museum another day because they are probably gonna store your bag
me: Hey sorry haha just got off the phone with Alex and my analyst! Oof. There was an issue with updating the time delay results release batch !
me: I think things should basically be ok now (knock on wood)
me: But yeah! I mean, I think the museum would be cool, you’re probably right that they’d make me store my bag but I think that’s ok. Just for the sake of discussion, is there something different we could do where I could have my laptop with me?
budy: nah we should definitely pursue our unrealistic tendencies, i think they might be more realistic than we think 
budy: oof i hope everything is ok!
me: It’s all good my analyst is just going to tell someone to build some stuff haha
me: What are you up to?
me: Hey ʕ•̫͡•ʔ I had a lot of fun today! Honestly I’ve never really met anyone who likes so many of the same things as me and I always have fun with you! Maybe it’s dangerous to encourage each other’s unrealistic tendencies haha
budy: nothing much really, i want to maybe draw or something today because i haven’t in a while
me: So yeah, thanks for another good day; I don’t know what i want in life, but for right now, I am happy, and you definitely contribute to that
budy: yeah i’m not entirely sure of other activities at the moment but i’ll keep thinking
budy: yeah same! i’m very glad to know you, every time has been really fun and it’s definitely made me happier and less lonely in this place!
me: I was thinking I wanted to draw, it’s been quite a while, so that sounds fun!
budy: so dangerous >:D
me: Yeah maybe we can plan on going to the museum if we can’t think of anything better. Sound good?
me: Haha I choose to believe that you are right! I mean, someone’s actual job was to design a chocolate factory themed office building! They probably got HELLA BREAD for it too.
me: I think we could come up with some better stuff than what Epic has honestly haha
me: What are you going to draw?
me: But yeah, maybe we should embrace it, I know I’d be happy and I appreciate your encouragement!
budy: ok! how about ~1:30?
budy: so much breeeaaaad
me: Sounds goo!
budy: probably more than the two slices a day...
budy: i was relooking at your conference room design and i love that you included the squid beak haha
me: *good lol
me: I’ll plan on meeting you there!
budy: ok
me: Ok! Well, yeah, I mean, if you’re busy or would rather just go another time you can definitely just let me know, ok?
budy: no i definitely want to, i was probably gonna maybe go sit in a coffeeshop downtown after anyways and maybe draw some things
budy: you are welcome to join!
budy: or do other non work work haha like friday
me: Ok cool, that sounds lovely :) maybe we can be more productive haha
budy: can we aim for 45 instead?
budy: might be more realistic!
me: Haha I was going to ask the same 👍
budy: it’s gonna probably be a little longer, ill tell you when i’ve parked 
budy: so definitely err on the later side of 45
me: Just got here! Let me know when you park but take your time :)
budy: parallel parking is hard
budy: yikes
me: Oh no! I believe in you!
me: I drove too because I wanted to leave my backpack in my car.
me: I had no idea where to park though! You’re the expert on the parking lots here!
budy: im almost there 
me: That’s a lot of gluten!
me: I really want to try out one of your coral chairs. If it were actual coral it’d probably be pretty uncomfortable but I’m sure the esteemed industrial designer, Vidya Giri, has something clever in mind
budy: i hope so! uncomfortable chairs are not ideal
budy: how’s the day going so far?
me: The day is ok so far. I need to write both a tech note and a qa note and I don’t know want to mess them up too bad.
me: I got an email from UPMC’s mychart manager and she was like “thanks very much for the speedy assistance!” So I felt appreciated which was nice!
me: How is your day going so far?
budy: so appreciated! that’s nice 
budy: i’ve been surprisingly busy, there’s definitely been a lot to do
budy: darn we should have gone to the fortress today via cowbikes!
budy: it just dawned upon me
me: Haha yeah it’s good to feel appreciated!
me: Oh! That would’ve been fun! Sorry, I would have loved to hang out but I thought I was going to talk to Katrina tonight. But sounds like she’s busy, so now I’m just at home contemplating the best way to temporarily save an unknown about of data until the user explicitly saves the game. Fun night!
me: But yeah we definitely should’ve cowbiked to fortress
me: Oh well, we can explore the underground tunnels to get there!
me: What are you up to?
budy: i haven’t been doing too much either, it’s my turn to clean the kitchen and i’m trying to get up and do it!
budy: it’s decently sunny tomorrow and wednesday so i’d say we have a shot
budy: but that saving thing definitely sounds like a challenge, is that for your game?
me: I think you can work up the courage to clean your kitchen! It always takes a lot of mental energy to clean a kitchen.
me: Cool! Let’s try to ride bikes tomorrow or the next day. We could probably do that and trivia, right?
me: Yup! It’s for my game. Saving is so boring but I realized I need it before I can make chests to put items in.
me: We need to come up with some more drawing prompts that we can do! Start a list!
budy: tomorrow brings a lot of excitement
budy: i will start a list >:D
me: I look forward to more drawings!
budy: i’m pretty much done! what time is trivia?
me: How is your morning going?
budy: im in a usability class hanging w wonka
me: Hey :) come by my office once you’re done and we can go ride bikes! Also sounds like trivia is just us and Andrew. Should we ask the group?
me: That’s fun. Honestly I think Wonka could stand to learn about usability. Like candy that lasts forever or soda that makes you float... there are some logistical issues I think.
me: Is this just something you signed up for because it’s interesting? Sounds like a class you’d enjoy!
me: Cool! Me too. It’s been so long I had to look it up! It’s at 8
budy: yeah just for fun!
budy: have to get back now
budy: when are you taking lunch?
me: I am walking to lunch right now! Meet at Cass?
budy: sure!
me: Did you find the leaf?
budy: no :,(
budy: what a tragedy?
budy: lost a real treasure today rip
budy: ￼i have this pic though!
me: Oh no :,( that is tragic!
me: Well, I will journey up north to retrieve you a new leaf.
me: That picture will guide me!
me: What are you up to? Anything?
budy: oh no don’t worry about it! our leaf will be fondly remembered though!
budy: not too much, just finished dinner and now will probably review stc
budy: exploring around was fun (as it always seems to be with you) today!
budy: hehe sorry it ended up being a longer adventure than imagined but it was a good one and i’m excited to read those books 
me: I probably will honestly: I tend to be pretty sentimental! I saved a bottle cap, after all
me: Stc studying is always a party! I’ll try not to be too distracting
me: Yeah :) exploring was fun! And don’t worry about it being a long adventure! I feel happy when I’m with you.
me: Yes! I can’t wait to learn all about how everything that doesn’t work is the object’s fault, not mine!
budy: no really it’s fine! lp
budy: oops sent too soon, but anyways are you up to anything fun?
me: We’ll see! Nope, I’m not up to anything fun. Still trying to make my game save stuff. Also my mom called and was asking about what to do and I was like I have no idea.
me: Good luck on your test! I believe in you :)
budy: lol i cancelled again because i want to do a review of 1 before 2
budy: but thanks!
me: Oh! That’s fair. I think doin 1 first is a good idea too. I still believe in you anyway ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
me: How is your morning going?
budy: it’s been busy!
budy: thanks for believing in me 
budy: i believe in you too!
me: Yeah I’m busy too. I don’t know how to answer any questions
me: I feel like I’m usually better at knowing everything about one thing, whereas this job requires knowing something about a lot of things
me: You’re so funny going to get leaves!
me: And you told me not to! Haha
me: Why were you up there anyway?
budy: i went to review my stc exam at orpheum so i just took a quick swing by since i had an awkward gap before my next meeting 
budy: leeaaaaves! worth it
me: Hey Vidya! What are you up to? Just had dinner with the fam.
me: What was the thing you said would be inappropriate to go to and you’d tell me later?
me: I’m burning with curiosity!
budy: oh cool, how’s it going?
budy: it’s good they made it here after all! did you figure out what you wanted to do with them
budy: not up to much, was just on the phone
budy: so i’m not entirely sure of what this event is but jesse invited me to a halloween party on facebook but i don’t think it really makes sense to go as it is a little up north at a lake house
budy: and is allie and her boyfriend(?)’s event so i am not sure what it is
budy: since i am like secondhand invited here
budy: but i haven’t seen jesse all week so i’m not sure what is up with it
budy: but yeah it’s not bad or anything but lol just didn’t want to talk about it too much until i know what this event is
budy: but probably won’t go since it seems quite far and it might awk for me to go, and definitely don’t have a halloween costume
budy: would i need one for freakfest too hmmm
budy: are you gonna do a costume?
budy: also i haven’t used skype yet but seems useful 
me: I guess so... I didn’t realize you were expected to dress up!
me: Me neither!
me: What made you change your mind about going?
budy: i didn’t want to bother with a costume... i know, pretty lame
budy: gotta start thinking 
budy: did you get tickets 
me: Haha that’s understandable! Yeah, gotta think!
me: I don’t have tickets but I will get them 👌
me: Lloyd said he was going at my small team meeting so that means we could convince Lucas too haha
budy: cool! lloyd could probably convince lucas
me: Freakfest is supposedly 7-1:30. Should we try to meet downtown around 7?
budy: yeah sounds pretty good!
me: :D cool! I was worried I wouldn’t see you at all this weekend haha
budy: yeah it should be fun then!
budy: i have skype now!
me: I’m listening in on a conversation from the office next to mine about what they’re dressing up as for Freakfest... it sounds important to dress up! But what should I be? 😰
budy: what were they doing???
budy: 😱😱
me: Haha don’t worry! One guy and his friends were going as Mario people and one girl and her friends were characters from top gun.
budy: hmm ok
budy: you should be a blueberry 
me: Hmm that’s good but I worry it’d be a little TOO spooky.
me: ￼Or sexy, I mean look at that guy
budy: wow
budy: so beautiful :,)
me: Oh! I forgot to ask- how was your STC exam?
me: I feel really distracted; I can’t focus on anything
budy: good!
budy: yeah same herr
budy: here
me: Hey! Did you get a ticket? I didn’t have any time yesterday so I guess I’ll just incur the extra $5 charge.... also I don’t know when I’m going to get a costume, but I’ll figure it out!
budy: no, i’ll just buy it over there, online is will call anyways and about the same 
budy: i’m trying to figure out transport too
me: Oh ok that makes sense
me: Hmm, well, I could get costume stuff closer to you then pick you up?
budy: hmm that sounds like a pretty good idea actually do you have your car today?
budy: i could also just park nearer to where you live
me: Yup! Yeah that’s also an option, but it should be fine for me to get you!
budy: hmm ok that probably works for me, if you change your mind though let me know!
budy: i can definitely drive too
me: Ok! I’ll keep you posted, but that should be ok! ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
budy: ok
budy: sounds goood!
me: Does Sowmya want to go too?
budy: thinking about it again, it might be easier to drive, i might just do that instead 
budy: no i don’t think she wants to come
me: Ok that’s ok too. You can park near my place and we can walk together!
budy: ok cool!
me: Let me know if you change your mind tho!
me: Are you getting costume stuff today?
budy: did you know what you’re gonna be
budy: i think i’ve figured something out! 
me: Oh yeah? :0
me: What is it? Or is it a surprise?
budy: i have this peacock dress so i just got some extra feathers from the store! wow costume!
budy: not super fancy but it works 
budy: are you still doing shaggy
me: Oh wow! That sounds lovely! I can’t wait to see your costume!
me: Yeah, I think I’ll probably do shaggy just cuz I don’t have time to do anything more complex
me: Hey let me know when you’re on your way! :)
budy: just leaving 
me: Cool! See you soon. Some roads are closed but you should be ok to get to where I am to park 👌
budy: just parked! we 
budy: oops
budy: heading over 
me: Ok! I’ll be downstairs!
me: Also my family is here.................................
budy: oh ok
budy: if you need more time thats cool too
me: No it’s ok! Just sorry you have to meet my parents they just randomly showed up here like two minutes ago
budy: im here!
budy: should i come up?
me: Hey :) just took my family to the airport. Did you do anything interesting today?
budy: i was just reading the books i got last week but not much other than that
budy: what did you do?
me: That sounds like a very pleasant day! We all just went to lunch then tried to look at the terrace but it was really windy and cold. So not much!
me: Thanks again for hanging out last night, I always have fun with you. I hope my couch was sufficiently comfortable haha when I said that I can’t spend more than 14 hours around people before going crazy, somehow that doesn’t seem to apply with you, just so you know. It feels very natural to talk with you!
budy: it was pretty windy today!
budy: it was a fun time, thanks for lending me your couch!
budy: and pillow and blanket
budy: maybe you are going crazy but you just don’t know it...
budy: anyways i definitely enjoy talking with you about nonsensical things! one day we will have to finish coco too
budy: im exhausted right now! i blame you for this!!!
budy: (just kidding i will probably just pass out super early tonight)
budy: oh also do you have that picture we took at the mountain dew stand?
me: Nonsensical things are good! Sometimes we also talk about real things which is good too
me: And yeah, maybe we could watch it after work sometime this week?
me: Oh no! I’m sorry :/ I’m definitely to blame for your exhaustion. 
me: Speaking of, I should really unregister for 7:30 ECSA exam haha that’s not happening :D
me: Chris has the picture actually, I forgot! I’ll have to ask him for it.
budy: yeah i like our conversations 😊
budy: we can definitely figure out a good time and plan for your birthday!
budy: 7:30 ecsa yeah!!!
budy: going to ts support philosophy?
budy: also you were in the birthday email!
me: Guess not :/ I didn’t sign up cuz I had the exam, now I have a meeting with reed
me: Wow! I wonder if I have chocolates too!
budy: CHOCOLATE
me: I didn’t have any chocolates :(
me: Also I guess the next support philosophy isn’t until January! I hope that’s ok....
me: Also the SLG system emailed me basically saying WHY ARE YOU SO BAD AT YOUR JOB?!
me: Why am I so bad at my job, Vidya? :,(
budy: what really i guess you suck...
budy: but that’s actually really funny what did it say? just that you had slgs?
me: 4 unacknowledged slgs and one stalled slg. I didn’t know you had to acknowledge them. Nor did I know how to fix them.
me: I’m really bad at following processes somehow.
me: Also how screwed am I for not taking the class you’re in?
me: I guess it’s funny, but I’m kind of upset really
budy: it’s basically like brians service presentation but by brett the ts division lead
budy: you’ll probably be fine
budy: are you getting lunch?
me: How was lunch? Did I miss anything? I was talking with Reed. And didn’t really want to take an hour long lunch break
budy: nah, it was pretty quick since i wanted to review a little before ecsa
budy: good you were finally able to catch up with him!
budy:  im about to head there so hopefully it goes well!!!
me: ￼Monday punday!
budy: general mills 
budy: they might be the same 
budy: i think it was in the last one
budy: sorry if i spoiled most of them for you!
me: Oh no! Ok well I’ll send you more and you can see
me: ￼
me: Haha I like that one
me: Have you seen that one?
budy: yeah haha
budy: german engineering right
me: Yup. So you’ve seen these ones?
me: ￼
budy: yeah that ones good haha!
budy: parks and rec :)
me: Aw, well this is no fun if you’ve seen all of them! David (the trainer) is actually pretty funny
me: ￼Since you’re so clever, here’s one I found on the website. It’s also spooky!
me: Now we ARE on a break! I’m really bad at Monday pundays... I don’t know what the grim reaper one is. Any guesses?
me: ￼Did you do these? Try to figure out which document was used to make the word clouds?
budy: lord of the rings???
budy: hmm i’ll keep thinking on monday punday...
me: Close! The Hobbit. That’s the only one I took a picture of.
me: And good. It seems pretty tough, maybe we should open up a new Sherlock for this Monday Punday
budy: i got it!
budy: death row 💀 
budy: also do you have a specific days that works for finishing coco?
budy: and also anything in particular for your birthday?
me: Oh! You’re so clever *o*
me: Hmm... really any day would work for Coco. We could even watch it tonight if you’d like.
me: I don’t know if Ill do anything on Tuesday or Wednesday for my birthday or Halloween. But we should go out on Saturday!
me: I guess I’ll think a little more about some specifics actually, I haven’t been able to think about it with my family here haha
budy: soooo clever
budy: tonight would probably work for me!
budy: if it’s not too soon 
me: How about this: We watch Coco either tonight or Thursday, up to you! Tomorrow we can do trivia but invite our team too (I doubt they’d come but we can still ask!) then we can still plan if we want to do something Halloween night! Andrew is gone on Friday but we could still go out, then actually officially celebrate my birthday on Saturday afternoon/evening with a non-spooky get-together :)
me: As a very loose outline haha
budy: very nice outlining. well tonight definitely work for me if you want to do that!
budy: *works
me: Ok yeah! Let’s do it :) Are you still here? If you come to my office we can figure out some more specific details!
budy: yes im here
budy: let me know when you’re done 
me: Ok! I’m basically done whenever, just filling out that 1:1 thing
budy: ~doot
me: ~doot! That’s a pretty spooky picture isn’t it?
budy: province hill apartments 
budy: 7538 mid town road
budy: apt 310
budy: just got here!
budy: i’m waiting on the swings
budy: inside now, let me know when you’re here
me: Ok sorry Siri doesn’t know where in the hell I am I’ll get it tho
me: Yeah sorry it’ll be a few more minutes, my phone was being really stupid >:(
budy: no problem 
me: Ok! I’m here
me: I’m at the swings
budy: okeh
budy: Let's be friends in Pokémon GO! My Trainer Code is 9749 1698 6244!
budy: lol thanks for “watching coco” with me!
budy: definitely had some very real conversations today haha im sorry it was a lot but i found it very interesting!
budy: i’m glad to know you and have someone to talk to (about it seems almost anything)
budy: but yeah another fun time :)
me: Haha I had fun watching coco. It’s a good one!
me: Haha don’t be sorry! I think it’s very interesting! Like, I guess I’ve never really thought too much about it. Sorry I stayed pretty late haha
me: But yeah, I’m very glad to know you too, and I always like talking to you. I think we make a good team; I like hanging out with you!
me: If I were Indian I’d be ok with being arrange married to you lol
me: Jk but yeah! It was fun
budy: no i liked having you over!
budy: lol i guess i definitely wouldn’t be opposed that
budy: you’re pretty cool! sorry for keepin you late
budy: also now we are pokemon go friends so there’s also that
me: Yeah we should hang out at your place more often, it ends up being less driving I guess
me: Yeah, too bad I’m not Indian ;)
me: I definitely don’t mind staying up late! That is well established
me: And yes! We need to play for 90 days so we can be best friends lol
budy: ￼it’s been 84 days i guess
budy: honest talk about cultural differences is pretty rare to come upon so it was refreshing to talk about it today (but really i guess personally i don’t really care if someone is indian or not)
budy: maybe i’m sappy but i definitely hope it would just be someone who likes me and makes me happy and i do the same in return for them!
budy: that would be ideal but who really knows what will work?
me: Oh man, well, I guess even if we wanted to be best friends we couldn’t yet :/ a couple more days.
me: Yeah it was really interesting to talk about that! Like, it can be very sensitive for people. As long as nobody’s trying to say their way is better it works
me: I was wondering that: whether you cared if you are with someone Indian or not. I mean, it’s important to respect your own culture, but also, maybe it shouldn’t matter where someone is from if they care about you and make you happy the same way. One thing I’ve learned: everyone loves differently, but experiences love the same way.
me: Well, I’m definitely sappy, and I think anyone would be lucky to be with you. You certainly make me happy
me: So I don’t think you have anything to worry about.
budy: experiences love the same way, i like that
budy: that’s nice of you to say! i don’t mean to be self deprecating or anything but i don’t think many people would say or think that so definitely appreciate that
budy: i will probably still have worries though, but i think it’s normal to have those when thinking about the future 
budy: happy birthday!!!
budy: didn’t realize it was midnight but anyways wishing you the best and you’re amazing!
me: Wow! Thanks :D those are some very nice balloons! You are the first to wish me happy birthday!
me: This also marks 85 days of knowing each other ;) lol
budy: as i have stated on previous occasions: you’re truly one of my favorite people to be around in recent times especially in wisconsin and otherwise! i’m always so amazed at how easy everything is with you and how much we have in common. i’m extremely grateful to have got to know you over the past 85 days and hope for anymore i can get :)
budy: yes 85! so in sync
me: Aw, thanks :) Even though we haven’t even known each other for long enough to be best friends in Pokémon Go, I feel like we know each other pretty well honestly. I’ve found you to be very easy to talk to and spend time with for all 85 days! You are absolutely one of my favorite people... of all time really. About what you said, I get that. I think it’s ok to only have a small number of people who you are close to. I’m definitely the same! But yeah, you really do make me happy, Vidya, I like you a lot. I hope for many more than 85 days with you, I’d really enjoy that
me: And I worry too. It’s normal. I feel like I worry less when I’m with you if that means anything to you!
me: So thanks for the birthday wishes and just for being you also🦒
me: ￼
me: Looks like it’s going to be pretty rainy the rest of the day. I wouldn’t blame you if you don’t really want to go to trivia, I feel kind of indifferent about going in the rain!
me: I forgot to ask the others anyway
budy: hmm i think others would be interested! did you want to get dinner beforehand
me: I feel like maybe no big dinner together, that’d probably take too long I think.
me: Did you get my message in GroupMe? Did that work?
budy: yeah i guess we can just meet there at 8
me: I mean, what do you think? Should we do dinner first? I mean like we could just do a smaller dinner like just us and Sowmya and maybe Andrew or whatever, that’d be ok too
budy:  hmm it’s up to you!
budy: any place you would want to go?
me: Ok, what if we do dinner just us and Andrew and Sowmya? Andrew just asked about dinner so sounds like he’d be in! Sound good?
me: I don’t know where to go! We could do Korean bbq?
budy: do we close our doors for the halloween thing?
budy: that sounds coool!
me: Oh... I don’t know! I’ve never had my door closed!
me: But yeah! I’ll look into the Korean place!
budy: i think david might be able to do dinner too
me: Ok. Planning to carpool?
me: I guess we might as well just say everyone can come haha
budy: yeah!
budy: candy situation ok?
budy: haha
me: Ok I’ll just tell everyone.
me: Yup! Lucas came by and gave me a huge pile of candy haha
me: Thank you for letting me have some of yours too!
budy: of course!
budy: 👻
budy: are you there?
me: No, traffic was really bad! Are you there?
budy: just reached 
budy: lmk when youre here!
me: Just got here!
budy: ok ill come down!
me: Ok! I’m at your front door thing
me: Take your time tho! Like do whatever you need to do!
budy: 
budy: 
budy: 
budy: 
budy: 
budy: 
me: ￼
budy: hey andrew! me and evan are headed to the constellation
budy: we can meet there before heading to dinner!
budy: see you soon!
me: Hey :) thanks for hanging out with me tonight! It’s really special to spend my birthday with you haha
budy: well i certainly had a fun time and i hope you had an amazing day!
budy: ￼￼
budy: here’s that pic i took of you guys!
me: I did have an amazing day! Our team is really great, everyone made it very fun! I loved the memes too haha classic
budy: wholesome :)
me: Those are good pictures!
budy: yeah!
me: You made it an especially nice day :) I guess Emily’s friends think we’re dating maybe we should show up to things separately sometimes haha but that’s ok, I like spending time with you
budy: yeah i guess that’s a little weird but i don’t know why she doesn’t just tell them we aren’t??? but i very much prefer to spend time with you rather than care what they think ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: or i guess maybe we should just never hang out again...
budy: 😢
me: Haha yeah I don’t know why she doesn’t just say that!
me: Yeah I guess we can’t hang out anymore lest people think we are dating :/ oh well it was fun while it lasted.
me: 😰
budy: sigh...
me: That’s funny, but yeah, I mean, like what you were saying: it’s just like a really good friend. And you are that.
me: I guess it’s still different but yeah, thanks for being a good friend and making it a good day!
budy: yay! glad to hear!
budy: i guess i don’t really find myself opening up to many people (even friends i have known for years) but somehow i like how easy you are to get along with and talk to
budy: i really enjoy hearing what you say and you are one of the most interesting people i’ve met in a while!
budy: lol also did you want me to send you the memes
budy: ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
budy: you were so happy about zoo tycoon 2!
me: Aw, well, I honestly feel the same :) I think I tend to be somewhat distant, like I don’t open up to a lot of people, often just don’t even know what to say! You are special. I don’t know what it is about you, I mean we have a lot in common but I think it’s also just fundamentally who you are. I mean... this is kinda weird to say maybe but... like how I was talking about how there’s not one perfect person out there for each of us, it feels like every time I learn something new about you it almost makes me question the limits of that, like I didn’t think there were people out there who thought in such a similar way. Haha that’s just something I was thinking! And thanks for the memes! That’s definitely the most random but hilarious present I’ve ever gotten!
me: (Sorry, sometimes I prefer one big block of text so I can get my thoughts down without a time limit!)
budy: i agree, we do seem to think in a weirdly similar way, and you’re right i usually have no idea what to say ever! but ya know glad it’s working out and you weren’t weirded out by the memes (honestly 100% david and andrew, although i contributed the giraffe pic)
budy: also i don’t know if it is weird that we seem to end up spending a lot of time together alone but if that’s ever weird to you just let me know (but from my perspective it’s definitely been very enjoyable to spend time with you and i have not found it weird in the slightest)
me: I don’t think it’s weird! Honestly it’s nice, like you can get to know someone so much better just one on one (1:1) I think. I don’t know how that all started, but I do really like having time with just you!
budy: i definitely agree!
budy: happy halloweeeeen!!!
me: Happy halloweeeeeeeb!!
me: How was your test?
budy: it was pretty easy! i got everything right
budy: whatchu up to
budy: i just studied this morning so i guess it worked out
me: Wow haha you got 100%? Nobody believed me when I said they were not that hard!
me: Still getting everything right is hard, you’re just very smart😄
me: I am not really doing anything! Things seem kind of stable right now
budy: i see! i’m in the barn bridge hehe
budy: just working on training stuff finally 
budy: also no, it wasn’t me it was just somehow really easy or i was lucky
me: Oh! You’re in the barn bridge! That’s so fun! And that’s good that you finally have time for training- I feel like we might have to start like working on customer stuff until 5, then stay late just for training.
me: I’m not convinced, I think you’re just smart
budy: yeah that’s what i would expect... but everything else is under control at least today
budy: i haven’t been added on guru to my third customer yet so once i start seeing those it’s probably gonna be more work
budy: yeah! having sooo much fun over here
budy: are you wearing your hat?
budy: that would be pretty fun
me: That’s good that everything is under control! ...for now
me: I guess I got lucky, I only have one customer who I am listed on Guru for. I guess it’s a big one though with lots of complex issues. But in a way that’s better even (for now) because I just have to accept that I can’t solve them and refer to someone else
me: I’m sure it’s a party :)
me: I was wearing my hat but Emily said it didn’t go with my outfit.
budy: yeah i mean i still really don’t think i know how to do much but i guess i’ve learned a few things 
budy: that’s a shame...
budy: bacon fried rice i think would be good!
budy: i completely forgot the menus existed but thanks for helping me out
budy: if it’s too much though like don’t worry about it
budy: i can pick something up at 1:30 and i have some fruits to tide me over
me: No don’t worry! Anything for you, Vidya :D I will get you that
me: Call going late?
budy: excited for your service coach meeting???
budy: haha
budy: it was really quick but good!
budy: doing anything fun today?
me: Not that I know of! Are you?
budy: nope
budy: haha do you want to attempt coco again
me: That’s what I was going to suggest haha
me: That would be fun :D
budy: cooool!
budy: well i’m pretty much done since i was actually productive and efficient today
budy: and woke up super early to study
budy: it’s pretty weird
budy: i just logged my time 
me: Wow! That’s amazing!
me: You’re so on top of it!
me: I’m thoroughly impressed, I got here super late today
budy: im still behind on stc but oh well
me: Probably the latest I’ve ever gotten here
me: I couldn’t park in zodiac, I had to park in the farm lol
budy: oh wow that is late
me: So I was not productive!
budy: i just realized im in yoda 😭
me: Only like 9:20! That’s not the latest anyone has ever gotten to work!
budy: that was me yesterday!
budy: that’s not terrible 
me: Still late tho
me: But yeah! I mean, honestly I don’t have much else to do. So I can leave soon
me: That’s sad you’re in Yoda. Yoda takes so much effort to get to
budy: so does farm
budy: i’m gonna try a new way to get to yoda
budy: so hmmm what are you thinking?
budy: want to do it?
me: Ooh. What new way?
me: Yeah! Let’s do it!
me: Do you want to do the same plan as last time where we go to your place or would something else be better?
me: You’re welcome to go to my apartment!
budy: either works!
me: Ok! Well... maybe we should stay near you. Downtown might be crazy tonight too with Halloween
me: If that’s ok.
budy: ok sure!
budy: let’s do that, i guess i’ll meet you at my house!
me: Ok! Just make dinner again?
me: I can get stuff from the grocery store!
budy: no it should be fine!
budy: we shall see
budy: i think i’ll be leaving and you can just let me know when you’re there too
me: Ok cool! I’ll leave soon :) see ya in a bit!
me: We can totally attempt to watch this movie for a third time!
me: I’m on my way! See ya soon
budy: cooool!
me: I’m here!
budy:  ok
budy: comin
budy: thanks for watching coco with me! 😢😭
budy: it was a good one and i think we were very efficient this time around!
me: I know! We finally watched it!
me: 💀🍁😭
me: We were definitely very straight-to-the-point this time, which is honestly pretty unlike us haha
budy: it was quite odd
budy: well we shall have to dilly dally again some other time!
me: Haha yes we will definitely find time to waste time later
me: I hope you liked Coco! I think it’s one of my favorites! It’s so spooky, and like dark but in a cute way!
budy: i did! it was very good and emotional!
budy: very spooky
budy: DEATH
budy: well here’s a real piece of art for you to enjoy
budy: https://genius.com/amp/Young-ag-wingman-lyrics
budy: verse 2 🔥 
me: AG’s spittin straight 🔥! “Relations got me feeling sensations” truu 💯
me: Haha Young A.G. is a lyrical genius.
me: When do his new songs drop, I wonder?
me: He was almost a little tender there saying he was getting feelings for that hoe
budy: suppress that shit, i take no hits
budy: my thoughts always on thots
me: That’s what you gotta do, suppress those feelings for thots. ☝️ thot ✌️ thot 🔴 thot 🔵 thot
me: Completely unrelated: we need to come up with some more drawing prompts. Have you thot of any?
budy: that’s an amazing transition 👏 
budy: hmmm i hadn’t but i just thought of one
budy: have you got any good ones??
me: I know I’m so good with words. Should I be a soundcloud rapper?
me: I have not thought of any good ones, but I’d love to hear yours!
budy: i think they should be surprises!
budy: gotta draw fresh
budy: you would be an amazing soundcloud rapper. the best.
me: Ok! That sounds good :) well I will collect some too!
me: I’m not really sure what I want to do this weekend, like, it’d be fun to do something but I don’t like planning things haha
me: Like with a group you have to plan ahead
me: Unlike just you and I where we can just wing it
budy: yeah i mean we can do something low key
budy: yeah it’s definitely easy to plan things with you haha
budy: hmm i mean we can just do whatever you are feelin!
me: Yeah, something low key would be fun! Something like board games and whatever would be fun. Is there anything you want to do this weekend?
me: Hey! How is your morning?
me: Quick question also, do you run license counts in PRD or SUP?
budy: sup!
budy: or shd
budy: definitely not prd
me: Oh ya, I remember now that that is something we should specifically not do.
budy: it’s pretty unspooky
me: It’s still dia de los muertos though.
me: Did you do the EQU patient engagement stuff? I kinda forgot about that and now I don’t know what to do
me: Why am I so bad at this job? I think I’m just not good at this honestly :(
me: My ECSA just called me :0 he was trying to edit some text!
me: Turns out what we learned in ECSA about the difference between asp and asp.net isn’t 100% accurate: this was a classic asp page, but it called some .net stuff so the string was still in strings manager!
me: Wow
budy: wooah
budy: that’s crazy!!!
me: I know. Fascinating.
me: Mostly it was just interesting that this was the first time talking to someone on the phone without any advisor or anything!
budy: yeah that’s interesting 
budy: i just got added to 8 ohsu slgs and have to start the equ process 💀
me: That’s an unfortunate number of SLGs. They’re definitely being created a lot faster than they’re being closed for me so I presently have 14 for UPMC😐
me: I’ve been introduced to 2 customers today haha so I’m about to get a lot more too
budy: i did notice you had that other transition meeting!
budy: (somehow)
budy: how was it
me: Stalking my calendar more, Vidya? I have no idea what you’ve been doing cuz I mind my own business.
me: Unrelated, but have you done your quarterly 1:1? How do those work?
me: It was fine! Kinda awkward because it was a call specifically just for introducing me and they asked how long I’ve been here. Also Yash who I’m taking over for is very quiet
budy: well if you stalked mine you would know that i just had mine
budy: it was pretty good i filled out this website thing and it was sort of a more general big picture meeting 
me: Wow what a weird coincidence ;)
me: Ok interesting. Yeah, I feel like I can barely fill the 30 minutes but ok.
me: Have you been asked about your tenure on any transition meetings?
budy: yeah i was for vmc
budy: she was like are you on the newer side?
budy: and i was like: yes i’m on the fairly newer side 
budy: what did you say 
me: Haha yeah that’s a good way to handle it!
me: Brian told me earlier that if they ask I should just say “I’m finishing up training now.”
me: So I said that
me: But then Yash was like “yeah so he’s pretty new, just started in August.” And I was like wtf I thought we weren’t supposed to tell them that!?
budy: 😬
budy: yeah i was caught off guard by it
budy: but everyone says it’s ok to be honest so it’s probably fine 
me: Ya honesty is the answer.
me: Are you doing anything tonight?
budy: hmm i don’t think so
budy: are you?
budy: well except for at 7
budy: i liked that texas picture!
me: Haha I thought you’d like it! It’s a good one!
me: Sorry for not texting you back last night :/ I was on the phone for like all evening
me: Do you want to hang out later? The have fun email didn’t seem to have anything too interesting but I looked at communication, and looked up one of the bands and they’re pretty good actually! So just an idea. Maybe there’s something better to do
budy: https://www.facebook.com/events/2203671039856205/?ti=ia
budy: this one?
budy: which band was good?
budy: yeah i was going to ask you what you wanted to do!
budy: also if you want to not do anything that’s cool too
me: I would love to do something with you tonight!
me: Yup, that event. I only listened to Honeybabe cuz I forgot my headphones and didn’t want to keep holding my phone up to my ear haha
me: They were good! That’s just one idea though. And we could go out after or something if you so desire. I’m open to any ideas though!
budy: ￼they have legos in the legoland conference room in borealis!!!
me: *o* that’s not boring-alis at all!
budy: i’m listening to mr clean
budy: it’s my song of the day
me: My brother would be proud. He still hasn’t sent me the picture by the way!
me: What would you like to do later? We don’t have to do anything either, like, no pressure!
me: Hey, yeah I guess I don’t know what I want to do, but I’d still like to spend time with you because I like spending time with you haha See, I’m not good at planning things I’m sorry. But we could just go downtown or to Communication or even just draw stuff. I’d be happy!
budy: yes! i still want that pic!!!
budy: “so much bread gotta get that fiber” -yung gravy
budy: hmm yeah that all sounds fun and i would be down
budy: is there anything you would lean towards wanting to do
budy: i guess i’m maybe not feeling concert today
me: Yung Gravy probably gets more than 2 slices a day.
me: Yeah that might be a bit much on such short notice
me: Well, maybe we could just go out downtown. I suppose we could see what Emily is doing, she usually seems to go out on Fridays. What are you feeling? 
budy: yeah! well i’d love to draw with you too and we could probably also do downtown
budy: it does seem like emily probably would be
budy: have you asked her
me: I just texted her, she’s not here anymore
me: We could do both? Go downtown someplace and draw until it gets late enough to go to to bars haha
budy: yeah that could be cool!
budy: wait do you mean she’s out of town or not at work?
budy: you still here?
me: Cool :) I am indeed still here, I just mean she’s not in her office. She’s in Madison tho!
budy: haha ok
me: Are you still here then? When are you planning on leaving?
me: Emily says she’s going to have dinner with Jordan and his sister but might go out after
budy: ok cool! just got my groceries! 
budy: should be making it ~7:45-8 depending on how long it takes me to park
budy: should i bring drawing stuff?
me: Ok cool! Groceries! Good stuff.
me: Yeah you can bring it, I guess we can decide if we actually draw or not, but good to have!
me: Sounds good see you soon!
budy: ok
budy: here!
budy: so early
me: Wow! I’ll be down in a second!
me: http://www.historynet.com/today-in-history
budy: how about ~8:30
budy: thanks for hanging out last night and today! it was actually really fun to jump into the leaf pile with you
me: Hey :) wow so in sync! I was just going to text a similar thing haha thanks for spending time with me! I always have fun with you!
me: What do you think we should do? We can still play games but I’m not sure it’d be exciting enough to be worth you two driving all the way out here haha
budy: hmmm i’m definitely not sure
budy: how are you feeling? are you tired?
me: Haha I’m kinda tired! I feel content but I don’t know what I want (in many ways). I feel happy when I’m with you even if we’re not really doing anything exciting at all, but that also makes me worried (as I’ve mentioned before) that, like, I’d run out of things to even say. Maybe that wouldn’t happen.
me: So, yeah, I mean, maybe I could drive to your house to play games, that way it wouldn’t be making you two go so far for something not so exciting! You and I could also watch that movie if you want or we could just go out to bars but it’d be just us haha
budy: well running out of things to say is completely normal and will probably happen eventually, but even then i’ve definitely been having a great time
budy: i was taking a quick nap just now and feel so sleepy now aaah
budy: suprisingly i still feel like i would want to hang out more with you though
me: Aw :) well, that does make me feel better. You are sweet, I feel like you understand and so I wouldn’t feel guilty or awkward about not talking with you haha. Just being with you I’d be happy
me: Lol I did the same and now feel the same!
budy: ￼￼￼￼￼
budy: also here are some great leaf pics of you!
me: And yeah, I do want to spend more time with you (surprisingly)
me: Aw! So fall-ish! I think you have all the pictures, I’d love to see some of the ones of you too!
me: Well, if that’s surprisingly the case, what should we do? I could go there this time if that’d make sense!
budy: honestly even though i could hang out, i’m probably still pretty tired... hmmm
budy: maybe we should call it off? i wouldn’t want you to drive here or we go there if it doesn’t seem to be the right night 
budy: i’m not quite sure what sowmya is thinking though 
budy: ￼￼￼here’s the other photos of me and the pile haha
budy: thanks for taking them!
budy: so maybe we can table board games for another time with more people available?
me: Hmmm... well, yeah, maybe that would make the most sense... but I really would still be happy even if I drove there, we did literally nothing, then I left haha, so like, it’s not an inconvenience for me. We could just watch Ex Machina later or something haha up to you tho! Is there something we could do tomorrow?
me: Oh! Those are good! I don’t know what that UH guy was talking about, Rice girls are pretty cute ;)
budy: ￼￼this is from the uh game!
budy: i don’t think i’m gonna survive winter 😢
budy: i think i would be down to watch the movie if you wanted to! i guess we could take a break from each other too
budy: driving home was kinda scary in the dark and rain and it was terrible 
budy: going out to bars could be ok too
budy: actually it’s raining so maybe not
me: Oh, I guess you’re right :/ well, yeah, maybe no bars but we could still watch a movie. Haha I don’t feel like I really need a break from you but maybe some time apart is healthy too
me: Those two are very dedicated to hating Rice!
me: I think I’d rather do something chill like a movie instead of going out anyway
budy: hmm how about we watch a movie and do stuff on our computers! i do need to sort of organize all my old stuff and it was pretty fun to work alongside you last time
budy: that seems like it could be a fun indoor activity 
budy: non-work work!
budy: i would be ok with coming over there again haha!
me: That sounds lovely! :)
me: Well, I really would be fine going over there! That way you don’t have to drive in the rain and stuff. If you’d rather come here though, you are of course welcome!
budy: either way is fine, it’s not raining too much
budy: yeah i guess you could come here if you wanted
budy: would you want to do that?
me: Sounds good! I will go over there! What time?
budy: hmm anytime after 8:30 should be good by me
budy: sowmya will probably be here too so maybe she would watch the movie too
budy: if we end up doing that!
budy: what time would you want to come?
me: Cool! I will shoot for 8:30-8:45. Sound good?
budy: ok cool!
budy: sounds like fun!
me: Excellent! Well I look forward to seeing you soon!
me: Hey Vidya! Happy 90 day friend anniversary! We can officially be best friends now! ;)
me: Truly you have been my best friend in recent times, it is surprising to think that I’ve only been aware of your existence for 90 days when it feels like you are such a relevant part of my day-to-day life. Thank you for that
me: Doing anything today?
budy: i’m glad to have made such a good friend! here’s to many more days
budy: i’ve not done too much today but it was nice to catch up on sleep haha! and the whole day has been pretty dreary
budy: how’s your day going?
me: That’s good! Yeah, most of my day was catching up on sleep too haha it has indeed been gross out today, so staying in is for the best I suppose. Sorry for always making you lose sleep haha
me: Is there anything you want to do this week? I feel worried about it being cold and not being able to do anything at all!
budy: haha it was a worthy sacrifice of sleep!
budy: it does seem to be be pretty cold this week but i didn’t have anything in particular that i wanted to do
budy: did you have anything?
me: ￼￼￼I finally got these pictures from Christopher! What a good squad!
me: Yeah, I don’t think there’s anything I want to do. Maybe we can find something but maybe just a chill week would be ok.
me: What else is there to do? From what you’ve seen so far, do you feel like you could be happy in this place? Not to be dramatic but I keep asking myself that
budy: oh we should definitely still do waffle wednesday!
budy: thanks for the pics
budy: i think it’s always rough adjusting to a new placd
budy: do you feel like you won’t be happy here?
budy: what have you been feeling about it?
me: Haha yeah we have the perfect gluten-free funfetti waffles! A sure-fire hit!
me: Yeah, you’re right, it’s just hard to adjust to a new place. I guess I don’t know. I mean, like, I do think I’m not going to be that great as a TS haha, it’s just not exactly where my skill set is. That’s ok!
me: Madison is cool, but I sorta feel like I’d be happier in like, Denver... or Houston.
budy: yeah... i don’t think i know if i’ll be happy here forever but there’s definitely so many options for the future!
budy: and there’s always the possibility to move someday!
budy: i guess personally i’ll be seeing where this year takes me
budy: but i bet you could definitely move to houston or denver if you wanted
budy: honestly i kind of see myself as moving back to texas one day
me: You’re right :) yeah, I mean, I guess we just have to see where everything goes.
me: I guess what I’m really saying is... my entire time in Madison I’ve felt like I should feel guilty about moving here.
me: Yet I’ve actually been having fun.
me: Yeah, it might not be forever, but it’s a pretty enjoyable place! But I have a lot of people who want me to be elsewhere, you know?
me: It makes it confusing to tell how I feel about it. Deep down, though, I’d say I’m happy
me: (That probably doesn’t make any sense, sorry!)
budy: i mean i guess that makes sense with feeling guilty but i don’t think you should feel bad for being happy or having fun for now though
budy: it’s definitely confusing trying to figure out the future!
budy: it does sort of make sense though
me: Yeah, I should just allow myself to be happy for now. But it’s still confusing. I dunno, it’s a lot more complex than that, but won’t get into it!
me: Thanks for listening though! You’re a good friend, maybe we can both live in Texas one day haha
me: I was thinking we should check if there are any good concerts coming up. It’s been a bit since we’ve done that! It’s true we can’t really talk during them but it’s still fun to do. If it’s a Friday or Saturday we can just talk after until 5am haha
budy: ok well i’m here if you ever need someone to talk to!
budy: yeah i’m down, was there anything you see that looks cool?
budy: we can do school nights!
me: I have not really looked, but just thought it would be fun!
me: Lol, Reed rescheduled again for 11 today....
me: Soon I will talk to him!
budy: sooon!
budy: i haven’t found kenton yet 
me: Haha well stay vigilant, he could be anywhere!
me: I saw where Phinneas’s office was, it’s near Ebbett field! He had a standing desk!
budy: woah
budy: haha why are we such stalkers 
me: Haha I am not sure. I think we started it because we both tend to fixate in small details in our environment and like sharing those details, then we continued it because we have started to feel sentimental about the joke itself!
me: (Or something like that)
me: Do you have any fun plans for this Monday night?
me: Oh😰 I’m sorry! Yeah, it was really stressful! Why doesn’t Epic have streetlights?! Seeing the stars is less important than seeing where you’re going!
me: That’s why I’m just going to live at Epic.
me: Did you make it ok, though?
budy: yeah i’m actually a little traumatized though
budy: most of the roads i got through to get home are very poorly lit
me: Yeah it was rough :( same with me honestly until I got downtown.
me: Is there some way we could solve this problem?
budy: i don’t know i’m really considering just driving with sowmya every day
me: Yeah haha I’m strongly considering driving with Andrew too!
me: It would be better if it weren’t raining
me: It won’t always be rainy and or snowy
me: So maybe just go with Sowmya when it seems bad?
budy: it was really bad though i couldn’t tell which side was going which way or where the edges of the road wete
budy: yeah i probably will
budy: so scary ahh
me: Oh no! Yeah it’s really hard when it’s raining! Somehow it’s harder to see in the rain than in the snow
me: Is there some way I can help?
budy: sorry for panicking about it
budy: i’m really shoook
me: No that’s ok! It’s really scary!
me: You know I don’t like driving in bad weather!
me: Is there some way I can help?
budy: actually can i talk to you rn
budy: sowmya’s not here yet
me: Yeah of course! Like on the phone?
budy: thanks evan, sorry for bugging but that was a huge help, feel a lot better now
me: Hey, you weren’t bugging me one bit! I’m always happy to help and it is flattering that you trust me enough to call when you are upset. It’s really scary! So I’m glad you are ok :)
me: You can just live at epic with me, I don’t want to drive anymore.
budy: yeah let’s do it! being at work forever is not depressing at all!
me: Well it’s less depressing than having to drive in the dark!
budy: yeah!
me: So let’s do it :) I call the red couch!
me: I don’t know where the showers are but I guess they are somewhere
me: You honestly could live there
budy: i’ll be in observatory, because ya know they have blankets over there
me: Oh that’s a good call. I assumed I’d bring my comforter but you never know.
me: I realized an important flaw in the Andrew driving me plan: he’s always traveling! He’s leaving this week! So I will be alone and sad in the dark
budy: i can’t commit 100% to that date because so far away but i’d maybe down then
budy: election viewing thing is tomorrow i’m assuming?
budy: also i think i might be interested in the election thing if it’s alright!
budy: ok!
budy: lol you can live at my house and sowmya can drive us
budy: just talked to sowmya about how i was feeling, thanks again for the support it was very helpful
budy: it may be seem small and insignificant but i was legitimately very terrified
budy: also dip!!!
budy: ￼
budy: ive been listening to dissolve me a lot now
me: Perfect! Yeah Sowmya can just take us both and I’ll be your third roommate who lives on the couch! :D
me: Of course! And it’s not that small, first of all, I think that’s super scary. Besides, even if it were small, it still upset you which makes it worth caring about
me: I’m glad you are ok :)
me: Unlike that guy’s cheek. Jeez thanks Vidya now I’ll look back through pictures of us playing in leaves and see that! 😢
me: It’s a good song! You keep saying you don’t listen to Alt J but each week a new song of theirs becomes your favorite song haha!
me: Maybe just commit to liking them? I really should listen to all of their music, not just the ones I know!
me: I have not really listened to any new songs yet this week. I’m open to suggestions!
budy: thanks evan! also thanks for the lovely weekend, playing in the leaves was quite fun :)
budy: we actually did a lot
budy: -korean food
-drawing at michelangelos
-opening the wine bottle
-drawing more
-her
-farmers market and cheese bread
-drawing at colectivo
-leaves!!!!
-finding a stick and interesting wood
-woodmans
-snickerdoodles
-mango nectar and lychee nectar with wine
-ex machina
-discovered the wonder of koopa kurl
budy: i really should commit to liking them honestly...
budy: as for new songs of the day i’ve also been liking heaven by clairo
budy: as a general band i think you would like though (which you would possibly know already) i would really recommend wildcat wildcat
budy: i like circuit breaker, garden grays, marfa, end of the world, hero
budy: wildcat! wildcat!
budy: i want to go to marfa one day!
me: We did do a lot! I was talking with Andrew and he asked what I did, and at first I didn’t know since there wasn’t like one primary event!
me: But I think he got tired of listening to me just rattle off things!
me: I had a lovely weekend too :) I think leaves were my favorite: it’s so childish but being an adult is boring.
me: Obviously we need to try real-life koopa kurling sometime!
me: Oh, I listened to some of wildcat wildcat a long time ago, but I have a lot to catch up on! I’ll listen to them this week :D
me: I can’t say I know much about Marfa. It’s a place in Texas, huh? Maybe I’ll go with you so 🎵 you don’t have to be alone
me: Do you want to watch the election results tomorrow hahaha? Sounds fun maybe....
budy: it was a fun time! it’s nice to be carefree sometimes and do the silly things! yes real life koopa kurling
budy: yeah i think the songs i like are a few years old but theyre pretty nice!
budy: very good use of lyrics 10/10
budy: i was kinda excited about the jazz thing honestly, but yeah maybe the election watching is interesting
budy: i wonder what part of the election they would be watching for though 
me: Doing silly things is the best! There’s no reason to be so serious all the time
me: Wow I’m glad you liked my use of lyrics haha
me: Yeah me too! I thought jazz would be fun! (Certainly more fun than watching the elections live!)
me: Maybe Emily can convince us that the election would be fun to watch but if not, we could always just go see jazz without her, or find something else to do
me: Hey :) want me to save a spot for you?
budy: yeah!
budy: almost there
budy: i probably won’t be making it, was gonna call my friend!
budy: thanks for letting me know though!
me: Might be hard now :/ he started talking.... you’ll be ok tho!
budy: no worries 
me: I’m sorry :( there’s a spot in front of Davis!
me: Look at like 8 o’clock
budy: where did you go to get the companion
me: I had to ask him haha so you go to cogito fundamentals curriculum on wiki, then scroll down and there’s a section called downloads
me: Download the cogito fundamentals camp training companion
me: Before you got here the trainer said tomorrow is just a work day so no class! (That means waffles in the morning!)
budy: yay!
budy: lol i should probably take me call though if thats the cade
budy: case
budy: yoops
budy: thursday 12-1?
me: Yay! Yeah we can change the time too
budy: another week?
me: What’s Thursday?
me: The new time for waffle Wednesday should be Thursday 12-1? That’d be a perfect way to throw people off! :D
budy: pen pineapple apple pen?
budy: wow!
me: Ppap
me: Wow!
me: Very surreal!
me: ￼
budy: far!
budy: i’ve never been there
me: Yeah we are Eh from Ohio. It’s an exotic place (I’ve never been either)
me: So you can’t make it to Emily’s thing? I feel like I am not too interested in elections so I might not go either
budy: yeah i don’t think i’ll go
budy: it could be fun to go to emily’s though!
budy: maybe another time 
me: Yeah it might be fun! I’ll consider it but probably won’t. I’ve never seen her apartment, just the outside!
me: We could try going to one of the comedy open mic nights tomorrow if you think that’d be fun
budy: so! how many eggs and oil to bring?
me: So! I’d say bring as many as you can before it’s inconvenient! We can always just leave them in the fridge.
me: Also... about the logistics of this event... I was wondering where we should do it. Cuz if it’s in my office, then it’s basically just my thing and I’d like for you to be included!
me: Did you vote and talk to your friend, Viidya?
budy: i did!
budy: should be fine in your office!
me: Ok yeah that’s probably easiest. Or just set it up in the break room for people to do themselves.
budy:  yeah!!!
budy: did you do anything?
budy: and bought more waffle mix?
me: Yup, I got more waffle mix!
me: I didn’t really do much else actually. I’ve just been working on non-work work.
me: Was talking to your friend good? I feel like there are a lot of friends I should talk to :|
me: Ugh I was going to be early but there’s a train in my way so I guess I’ll probably just get there at like 8.
budy: i’m running late too and will be getting there late aaaah
budy: im super sorry
me: :O haha that’s ok, knowing the two of us, probably should’ve just said it was later!
me: Hey Vidya :) everything ok? Just want to make sure my friend is doing well!
me: Do you have time for lunch today or want me to get you anything?
me: I forgot to stalk your calendar ;)
budy: fire alarm!
me: Oh no maybe it was the waffles! :0
budy: i unplugged them?
me: A bunch of people are just waiting in the hallway near deneb
budy: now im worried
me: Haha yeah I’m just joking
budy: ok good
me: It’s not the waffle irons!
me: Where are you?
budy: sorry we couldn’t do this tonight but maybe another time!
budy: deneb 1st
me: That’s ok! I wasn’t too attached to the comedy idea, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out haha
me: Oh me too. In a VSO or something?
budy: in the door closest to fomo
me: Oh this must be the ground floor. So you’re like above there the glass room is?
me: Call going late?
me: ￼Hey Vidya! I was wrong, open mic comedy isn’t $5 it’s only 2 haha do you feel like going? Or if there’s something else you’d rather do I’d be open to any ideas!
budy: ok! yeah today’s definitely a rest day for me 😴
budy: but $2 is so tempting
me: It’s good to just relax sometimes! We did a lot last week too so it’s nice to chill
me: We will definitely go sometime!
me: Are you doing any non-work work? I have at least one, maybe two projects that I’d love your help on actually!
budy: yeah we should!
budy: i was just thinking i should do something! woah what is it? im intrigued and excited!
me: Ok, so, I was thinking that it’s so dark now I need a way to stave off the darkness. Even my apartment is dark- especially that long hallway. So I want to have some sort of interesting light system to illuminate it. Like some of the tunnels at Epic. No specific ideas yet, but sort of a blend of technology and art. Would you like to help me?
budy: woah that sounds cool! i’m not sure i know much but i would love to help!
budy: i draw good circles you know 
budy: that’s a fun idea though 
budy: what’s the maybe two?
me: Ok, I was honestly so impressed with your circles like the two that were around A were so close together but didn’t cross at all and you drew them so fast! I was amazed *-*
me: And I think you have a lot to offer in terms of helping me!
me: You’ve shown me so many things that are all artistic and technical! I would love your ideas and your help! I wonder if we could do projection mapping somehow or something similar.
me: The second one, I will tell you about later if it becomes more fleshed out ;)
budy: glad you appreciate my circles!
budy: so much potential sounds ~exciting~
budy: and i look forward to that!
me: Yeah they were good circles.
me: I mean, don’t feel obligated to help it’s really not that interesting honestly.
me: Is there anything you are working on?
budy: i went to bed super early yesterday haha
budy: but haven’t been working on too much lately :(
budy: how’s the day going?
budy: how was the look and feel 
me: Wow you really were tired! Well, that sounds refreshing! Are you feeling better now?
me: Well, we can work on something together :)
me: My day is going well, I have the Caboodle exam later. Any tips?
me: Look and feel was good I thought I had it down but I think it’s one of those things where on paper it’s one thing but there are a lot more steps in practice. I have the rest to do still but it’ll have to wait for tomorrow!
me: How is Clinical Data Model class?
budy: i see, you’re gonna be the look and feel expert!
budy: caboodle exam is fine, honestly i really don’t get it
budy: im sitting in this class and i really don’t know how it works 
me: Look ‘n Feel master (not really, it’s like change one color)
me: You don’t get the class? Oh no! What is it even about? Like the data itself that gets reported on?
budy: how’s your evening been?
me: I’m sure you can figure it out! You’re very smart!
me: It’s been pretty good. Just on the phone this whole time. But now I’m going to work on non-work work! It’s weird that I’m excited by doing work
budy: i get the class but i’m not great at hammering out sql queries yet 
me: Did you clean your kitchen and water your plants?
budy: are you gonna get lunch at 12?
budy: nice! that means that you are enjoying what you are working on i guess 
me: Hey sorry had my 1:1. Are you going to Cass? I am heading there now!
budy: i did one of those things 
budy: need to do the other one soon...
budy: sure! im at fomo
me: Clean the kitchen Vidya! Quit putting it off!
me: Oh? Did you bring lunch? You don’t have to come here if that’s the case!
me: Hmm... wait maybe I should study for my test tomorrow.... or drop it.
budy: nah came back so i could catch you
me: Have you had a good evening though?
me: Aw that’s sweet! Haha ok! Well I will meet you here!
budy: ughh you are right...
budy: also did you finish cogito project?
budy: lol i bet you would probably be fine but idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: saw you were taking the exam tomorrow!
budy: it’s been alright! 
budy: sounds like you’re having a good evening!
me: Not yet! 😬 I still can’t figure out how to make the dashboard available to someone.... I guess I’ll stay late today to finish it.
me: I really cannot focus at all right now! I don’t know why!
budy: you can doooo it
me: It’s ok I put off cleaning the kitchen for far to long :/
me: I dunno, I’ll get up tomorrow, see if it snowed and if it did I’ll drop it. If it didn’t... I’ll probably still drop it.
me: What have you been up to?
me: Well, it’s been ok. I felt enthusiastic for like 30 seconds but now I’m back to just not knowing what I want or why I’m doing anything. Ya kno
budy: i was reading those books a little, watched the comedy things sowmya recommended and now im feeling 😴 
budy: aww well the things you do are super cool!
budy: i get it though, my enthusiasm to actually do things has been overwhelming low since moving here sigh
me: That’s a pretty good chill evening. I really should read my book!
me: Thanks! The things you do are super cool too!
me: Why do you think that is? It’s since moving here? What about here causes that? What things do you wish you were doing?
me: ^thats a lot of questions sorry
budy: i’m not sure entirely about the above questions i’ll have to think about it
budy: ￼snow!
me: Those are all things that I would really love to hear about. We can talk about them sometime if you’d like
me: Oh no! The roads look ok but still. Are you getting Sowmya to drive you?
budy: i’m gonna try driving today
me: Ok! Go really slow, alright? Press the breaks and accelerator gently, it’s acceleration that’d make you slip!
me: You’ll be ok though, it’s no different from rain right now
budy: thanks
budy: you’ll be ok too
me: Hey did you see in the outpatient have fun email that there’s a class on screen printing at the library tomorrow? You were literally just talking about that! Would you like to go?
budy: yeah sounds cool!
budy: did you decide to not take cogito? 
budy: and driving ok?
me: Yeah I was kinda worried about driving so I basically didn’t even leave until 8:30. I know that’s silly, the roads were perfectly clear! Oh well.
me: Driving was fine for you too?
budy: i also did the same haha
budy: but it was fine!
me: Glad we’re on the same page! But yeah it was fine.
me: Are you doing lunch at 12? I can meet you again and we can get Gelato too!
budy: i have to get lunch but should i go to small team?
budy: im debating 
budy: i’ll definitely be going to cass at 12ish though 
me: I think you’re probably off the hook for it since you have a class.
me: Nobody really takes ours seriously though
budy: yeah i think i’ll skip
budy: ill meet you at cass at 12
me: Ok! :)
me: Hey I’m at one of the long red tables near the windows
budy: https://goo.gl/maps/Grv3ukyjUCy
budy: Madison Public Library - Pinney
204 Cottage Grove Rd, Madison, WI 53716
(608) 224-7100
budy: i think it’s actually this one 
budy: https://www.madisonpubliclibrary.org/events/how-fest-screen-printing-1194292
budy: super awk seeing small team with my gelato 
me: Ah! Ok I was thinking it wasn’t actually the downtown one.
budy: thanks for convincing me to skip...
me: Well cool. Still want to do that?
budy: all your fault 
budy: sure if you want to
budy: we can also do something else 
me: Haha that was pretty funny. I don’t think anyone really cared too much, you’re in a class!
me: Man I guess I was really tired last night, like you only texted me 20 minutes after I texted you but I didn’t even hear it I was already asleep!
me: It wasn’t a stressful week but I was still really tired!
me: I’m a bad influence on you >:D
me: Yeah I mean I think it’d be interesting to check out!
me: If it’s not that cool we could probably just leave I guess
budy: yeah 😡
budy: just kidding! glad we got to get lunch
budy: did you know baby rabbits are called kittens
me: But I’m sure it’d be fun, especially with you :D
budy: the more u kno
me: You shouldn’t associate with me really.
me: Huh, I did not know that!
me: What’s the difference between rabbits and bunnies? Is there a difference? Or does bunny just sound cuter? 🤔
budy: i looked it up and they are the same!
budy: 🐰 
budy: yeah i shouldn’t associate 
me: Oh! So baby bunnies are called kittens too? Bunny kitten. That seems excessive.
me: Goodbye forever :\ oh well
me: 😢
me: Did you learn that fact as a fun stuff thing?
me: ￼There’s a lot to this one so maybe we will be different
me: Actually reading them again I don’t know if we fall on this chart
me: Hey Vidya! Does Sowmya’s plan of coming over at 8:30 work for you? I want to do whatever would make you happy!
budy: hooray 
budy: mooooo
budy: that’s nice of you!
budy: 🐄🐄🐄
budy: 🥛 
me: 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️
me: Inappropriate!
me: Get that away from me!
me: But you are good with that? It’s important to me! 😬
budy: get out my hay get out my hay
me: No more! It’s offensive to my ear-holes!
budy: i am not a cat i don’t say meow
me: Oh no! Vidya is only able to speak in lyrics from the song “Moo” by Doja Cat!
budy: bitch i’m a cow
budy: chili cheese fries for a starter
me: My milkshake brings all the boys to the farm
budy: must be a pretty good milkshake 
budy: farm campus is quite a walk away
budy: it might be more 9-9:30
me: I know it brings the boys from the wizard campus even!
budy: hi friends it might be more 9-9:30 if that’s alright!
me: That’s ok. Everything going ok?
budy: we are bringing the hot choc and we even brought mugs!
budy: ya! we are stopping by another event sowmya was invited too
budy: *to too
budy: i think it’s for diwali
me: Wow Sowmya is so popular!
me: That’s cool. Sounds like fun
me: How’s it going?
budy: sorry we late :(
budy: just got out of there :)
me: That’s ok!
budy: lol wish you were there woulda been more fun
me: Haha I would have loved to be there :)
me: Well, you’ll have to tell me all about it!
budy: moooo
budy: moooooooo
me: 😰
me: Stop mooing at me I’m scared!
budy: we here
me: Thanks for hanging out and doing nothing with me!
me: That concept is very strange to me really... everyone I’ve ever known I feel like they’d always need a good reason to spend time together
me: It sorta made me wonder like if they liked me just for me or for the things we did. So... maybe it’s a new thing to me to do nothing. I honestly like doing nothing with you but it’ll take a bit before I’m confident in how that works maybe!
me: Hope you still enjoyed it
me: Anyway, if you do want to go to the screen printing thing tomorrow, I think that’d be fun! Want to meet at the library? We can go to a movie or plan for making light art or something after and just spend the day together if you’d like that :D
me: Moooooo
budy: moooo
budy: (sorry for subjecting you to that)
budy: yeah i’ll try to meet you there!
budy: nope definitely no good reason to spend time with you besides just spending time with you
budy: which is valid
budy: i mean i think there are plenty of reasons and i’m glad we have been hanging out
budy: thankful to have good friends like you!
budy: woah!
budy: i’ll see if i’m up to it so that works for me 
me: We don’t have to watch a movie really!
me: Is there something you really would like to do that would make you happy?
budy: don’t know, any ideas
budy: we can see the movie probably
budy: i think i need to buy a lamp and maybe more plants
me: I was looking forward to going to Milwaukee (and Ikea)! I mean, maybe it’s silly and spur-of-the moment but you and I could go haha
me: Or we could take a trip someplace else like Devils lake
me: Just for fun
me: We really don’t have to do screen printing either if there’s something else you’d like better!
budy: im kinda down for a spontaneous trip
me: Yeah! It’d be super random but random stuff is fun!
me: Plants and lamps both suggest that you feel like you feel gloomy in your current environment haha
me: So we could go somewhere else
budy: but we can do screen printing too!
budy: oh no don’t worry about me haha
me: Doing ok Vidya?
me: If you want to! Totally up to you! I’m sure you could teach me sometime and that’d be even more exciting ;)
me: Are you close?
budy: yeah i might be a little late, i’ll try to leave soon
budy: yeah had to run back to get my hat and just parked 
budy: ill let you know when i’m there
me: No problem! Just keep me posted I will see you soon!
me: Oh no your hat! :0
budy: sorry!
me: Ok I’m in the lobby with Sowmya!
me: Don’t be! I look forward to seeing you in a bit!
budy: oh no don’t wait
budy: i’ll be like 5 mins
me: Doin ok? Do you need rescuing?
me: I just got here, let me know when you’re here too!
me: There is indeed at least one example of screen printing here
budy: ok cool
budy: it’s about an hour for four people 
me: Hey I’m here! Are you still in dotty’s?
me: I can’t seem to call you... Oh T mobile!
me: U up?
me: ^that was my Jesse impression
me: I’ve gotten accustomed to Saturday nights meaning stay up until 5am with Vidya! I miss that honestly.
me: Anyway, I hope you had fun and are doing alright. Winter is so dark and lonely, I want to stave off the seasonal depression with you. Lights and plants are great, but someone who cares about you is better, and I care about you.
me: But between Jesse wanting to hang out at 1am and Lucas inviting you to thanksgiving, you’re clearly popular enough that that won’t be an issue ;)
budy: lol he just asked how my weekend was going, he was probably just checking in
budy: yeah, unfortunately now that it’s gonna be winter now i guess our plans will have to be reconsidered 
budy: but i’m sure there will be more late nights in our future, im definitely glad i have a fellow friend that gets the night energy!
budy: i’m definitely more awake and energized when hanging with you
budy: but let me know if you ever need help with anything too!
budy: as for popularity that’s definitely not true if i look to past experiences
budy: but i definitely enjoy hanging with you! it feels natural and unweird
me: Yeah, right! It’s 1am, he’s probably drunk haha
budy: lol should i text him back now?
me: I think we can find some things to do inside! Watching movies is something’s fun. I enjoyed watching Her with you the most I think, but I think we could find better things too (movies make me bored and I kinda felt like I’d rather just talk with you during this movie)
me: Lmao I mean, if you want to! I kinda want you to just out of curiosity haha
me: I’ve never been “popular” either. I feel like I’m basically only capable of having one close friend at a time, but I feel good with that friend.
me: Yes, unweird, that’s the most flattering remark I’ve ever gotten haha 😂
me: You’re un-unweird, but in a way I really enjoy
budy: yeah we’ll find things!
budy: so what should i tell him that i’ve been doing this weekend 
me: Hmm... I mean looking at plants is pretty random. That’d be good. Just make it sound like you have really weird interests
budy: hmm ok i don’t know if that’s really that weird
budy: but it’s definitely true
me: Oh those were sorta two separate things.
me: I meant say it in a way that makes it sound weird
budy: im glad it was a flattering remark to call you unweird to hang out with
budy: i guess i just mean that i think we make good friends and for some odd reason i trust you, it’s hard for me to open up most of the time
budy: i definitely know most of my friends on less deep levels
budy: even though it’s not been too long
budy: although 90+days is clearly enough to be best friends
budy: glad to be un unweird though!
me: Haha I know what you meant :) Yeah it feels very natural being with you. I always like talking to you or just being with you and not doing anything haha
budy: “i went to a screen printing workshop and then looked at a lot of cool plants in a greenhouse how’s your weekend going”
budy: how’s that 
me: Yeah, I really feel like I know you well and that you know me well....
me: That’s good!
budy: good 2:05 am text?
me: It’s perfect
me: You can tell him you watched a bunch of vines too
budy: harharhar ok
budy: hmm i think that’s taking it too far
me: Oh yeah, maybe you’re right. He’d just want you even more
budy: lol honestly everytime i tell people what i did on the weekend it’s usually something boring 
me: Well, I feel that way about my entire life so
budy: but yeah he would probably be too impressed at that
budy: ok i’m gonna send it
me: You should!
me: I want to know what he says!
budy: well i think you are a solid good person 
budy: thanks for caring about my happiness :)
budy: it’s really kind of you
budy: you don’t even use ad blockers
budy: i’m very much enjoying the light in my room
budy: and i’ve moved a plant in here too
budy: let me if there is anything i can do that would make you happier
me: But... like... I think I’m kind of hard to know. Like I don’t let people know me. Somehow that’s not true with you, and so I think you know me better than just about anyone. I don’t know why but I think we have a weird sort of connection.
me: Well... thanks!
me: I think you are a very good and interesting person. I don’t blame Jesse for wanting to talk to you at 1am, it’s a good time
me: ^^^a weird but unweird connection
budy: 😴 goodnight
budy: can’t continue on
me: Goodnight Vidya
me: Sweet dreams 😴
me: Did Jesse respond to you?
budy: Oh shit that's awesome. I thought about the screen printing workshop. What plants were your faves?
budy: My weekend is going okay. Sucks being on call 😕
budy: Got any free time you want to kill? We could hang out if you're interested
me: Haha I told you he wanted to hang out with you!
me: I guess being on call is pretty boring, so maybe he was like... what’s the second most boring thing I can do... oh I know! Hang out with Vidya!
me: Just kidding!
me: Yeah he just really likes you
me: Well, if you replace me as your Madison best friend with Jesse I wouldn’t be offended, he’s pretty cool ;)
budy: sigh i told you
budy: he’s probably trying to get to you
budy: now i have to respond 
me: Yeah, hm. You’re right.
me: Well, I mean, you can probably just say you’re busy but another time, or invite him lamp shopping haha
me: What are you up to Vidya?
budy: lying in bed
budy: what are you doing 
me: Wow me too!
me: What do you want to get out of the day?
budy: probably just cleaning the kitchen, washing my hair, and groceries
budy: what about you?
budy: and maybe finding a lamp
budy: but also it’s warm today
me: All good things to do! I have no plans at all.
me: You’re right! It’s kinda nice! We should take advantage of it! Is there something you want to do outside?
budy: lol devils lake?
me: You want to? I’d be super down for a spontaneous trip!
me: I’m still in bed haha that’d give me a good reason to get up!
budy: yeah same
budy: ok i guess we should do it then
me: Ok! Let’s go!
budy: it’s only 48 minutes from here
budy: i guess we could drive together so you could come pick me up here?
me: Yeah I will go pick you up!
budy: i will be ready by ~1:30 probably
budy: (have to eat and stuff)
me: That sounds good, I’ll meet you then!
me: Yeah I have to eat too lol
budy: ok yeah anytime after that works 
me: Ok I will plan on being at your house around then!
budy: haha might need more time so don’t worry if closer to 2
me: Haha yeah I was thinking 1:30 was a little close
budy: ok! just keep me posted 
me: Hey I’m here! I’ll be at the swings. Take your time tho!
budy: do you want to come up
budy: i am almost done eating
me: Ok I’ll buzz your thing
me: That sounds weird :|
me: Of course :) you are important to me and I want you to be happy
me: I’m glad the plant and the lamp are making your room a more enjoyable place! 🌿💡
me: I feel very happy when I am with you, and I appreciate how you are supportive of me. I will let you know if there’s anything you can help with, but I hope you know that you already do make me happy by just being a good friend :)
budy: yeah same :)
budy: 🌿💡
budy: ◕‿◕
me: ◕‿◕
me: How was hosting your hosting meeting?
me: 😰 Vidya what should I make for small team cook off
budy: your family recipe 
me: My team already has dirt pudding, rice crispy treats, and apple slices covered lol we are such good chefs
budy: nice
budy: i need to figure it out too
me: Spaghetti with mushrooms was pretty👌!
me: Aw :( I tried to update the DisplayConfig file and now textbox for putting in your username is gone!
me: That’s important.
budy: i’m washing my dishes!
budy: hope you’re proud of me
me: I am proud of you! You’re someone worth being proud of!
me: I got brownie mix!
budy: honestly didn’t really do anything besides sleep and eat lunch 
me: Did you go to the store too?
budy:  it’s ok but thanks for offering!
budy: ok well let me know if you need anything too and we can try to sort through it
budy: not yet but i’m going to!
budy: yeah you can maybe come and try them sometime, it is vegetarian 
budy: there was a lot of traffic so i wanted to wait
budy: sounds like a lively lunch, how was the web ts meeting?
budy: i’m proud of you too!
budy: how was your day?
budy: i’m feeling better i think and will hopefully be good by tomorrow
me: I’ll certainly try.
me: That’s fair! Also better clean your kitchen before messing it up again.
budy: stay warm 
me: Good! I’m glad you are feeling a bit better :)
me: Know what you’re going to do?
me: Do you want some brownies? I have a bunch of extra brownies!
me: I’d love to try your tacos at some point too!
me: Aw thanks! I’ve been researching how to take care of a hedgehog haha
me: The meeting was good! A lot of people brought stuff. Some was really good! Jerry made some good brisket, Jesse’s meat loaf was good too. Veronica got a lot of votes with her “Vanilla milk” which I think is just a gallon of milk she put vanilla extract in.
budy: i would like some brownies, maybe tomorrow if you have any left but otherwise don’t worry about it
me: Both good things for a sick person to do! I should’ve taken some of Lloyd’s chicken and rice soup for you.
budy: not yet! 
budy: sounds yummy! i did like jerrys brisket last time he brought it
budy: and vanilla milk 🤔 hmmm
budy: really haha?
budy: mooooo
me: My day was good: learned about joining the virtual care team, had a mystart class, went to lunch, then had a UPMC call where I actually talked, then helped my ECSA with something (at first I felt helpful because I fixed his problem, but then he called later and realized I didn’t fix it well enough), then was the web ts meeting. That’s my day :D
budy: learned anything useful?
me: Ok! They’re really not special, but I’ll have some tomorrow. I’d also be happy to bring some to you if it’d help you feel better :)
me: Or is there anything I can get you? I’d be happy to help :D
me: Cooking is hard so that’s ok
me: And yeah, it was like the most low-effort thing ever but people liked it!
me: Got milk bitch? Got beef?
me: Haha yeah just for fun. I think you could totally be a good hedgehog owner!
me: Other than being sick, how was your day?
budy: ooh that’s good to hear!
me: Yeah, but they seem kinda picky, like they don’t like eating the same food over and over
me: Understandable.
me: We should make dinner again sometime this week!
budy: yeah i guess i’m the same as a hedgehog 
budy: that would be fun!
budy: anything you want to make 
budy: im going to the store soon
me: See! You would already have so much in common with it!
me: Hmm... well, I don’t know any recipes other than ants on a log
me: I guess something vegetarian (or at least optionally so) so Sowmya can eat with us.
me: Pasta is good vegetarian or like Mexican food (or Indian)
budy: https://youtu.be/VON5eO6eC74
me: Hahaha wow Ariana Grande shares your love of giraffes! Who knew?
me: You’re not the only “giraffe girl”
budy: yeah i guess so
me: Is everything alright, Vidya? What’s on your mind?
budy: yeah! is everything alright with you?
me: Yup! Just wanted to make sure! Andrew is gone again. I’m perfectly happy alone usually, yet I sorta feel lonely, like I want to talk with you. I don’t think I have anything to say though so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ that’s everything new with me right now.
me: Did you go to the store?
budy: i see i see
budy: well i’m here!
budy: yes i went and it was hard to get out of the hoyse
budy: house 
budy: i don’t have anything particularly interesting to say
budy: remember when we spontaneously went to devils lake yesterday!
budy: that was cool!
budy: in fact i remember it like it was yesterday
me: It can be really hard to leave the house when it’s so dark!
me: But at the same time it makes being at home cozier in a way
me: Wow yeah! Good times! Haha
me: It was really neat! I think it’s mostly popular because of the rock formations, and I guess we didn’t even see those.
me: We’ll have to go back.
me: There are probably so many interesting places to explore, but we just don’t think about them! Maybe we should just choose a random direction and go that way and then appreciate whatever we find. Someone did that at some point, they found devils lake!
me: I guess if we just appreciate everything around us, we will never run out of things worth seeing and doing, huh?
me: Also I guess I like talking to you even with nothing to say
budy: we will have to go again! 
budy: yes walking in random directions is a lot of fun and really let’s you find the unexpected
budy: i guess talking about nothing could be compared to walking in random directions in some kind of way 
me: You’re right: ultimately you might not end up anywhere at all, but if you’re lucky you made it “nowhere” with someone good.
me: I was cold so I took a really long shower... I guess it was almost 45 minutes 😬 rip my water bill
me: It felt good though. I was feeling stressed, but now I’m all better, so it was worth it
me: Anyway, goodnight, Vidya 😴
budy: i’m sick today :(
budy: i made cauliflower tacos but i guess i won’t be coming in today
me: Oh no! That’s no good!
me: 😢
me: Is there anything I can do for you?
me: Or get you?
budy: i’m not sure if i should just bite the bullet and come in
budy: but i guess might as well use a sick day
budy: do i just tell my tl?
me: Yeah, I mean, if you’re not feeling well, don’t push yourself and end up worse
me: I want you to get better!
me: I think you do just tell your tl
budy: ok first sick day yeah!
budy: also replyjng to what you said before
budy: nowhere can be somewhere!
budy: long shower huh? what were/are you stressed about?
budy: and also good morning to you 😴 
budy: im sad im missing the food :,(
budy: esp brownies 
me: First sick day! So exciting!
me: Nowhere and nothing can be nice. If someone is willing to go nowhere or talk about nothing with you that’s really nice
me: I dunno, I just have to make a big decision. That’s all
me: Sounds like it’s not that great of a morning, I’m sorry!
me: I know! That’s sad! I’m sad I’m missing cauliflower tacos. I’ll be sure to bring any extra brownies to you and let you know what everyone makes!
budy: well i’m here if you need someone to talk through it, big decisions are stressful 
budy: it is sad they were actually not bad, i guess i’ll just be eating them now 
budy: look forward to the report, hope the day is going well 
me: Well, I appreciate it. I think it’s sorta one where I’ll have to wait until after to tell you about it
me: I’m sure they were very good! I guess you just have tacos for days now. I’d love to try one!
me: So far the day is fine, we had lunch with Jesse and so I heard a lot of Vines acted out haha
me: I guess walking back from lunch I usually talk to you! I miss you 😰 how are you feeling?
me: Doing alright, Vidya? Is there anything I can do for you after work?
budy: lloyds chicken soup amazing
budy: sounds like you did quite a bit!
me: Lloyd is a man of many talents
me: It was a pretty decent day
budy:  thanks for the brownie!
me: Are you getting lunch at 12? I already ate, but I’d be happy to go with you for Gelato!
budy: yeah!
budy: no worries though
me: I’d love to go with you! Let me know when you’re going over!
budy: are you studying cogito?
budy: im not sure what to review 
budy: just the sample exam 
budy: yeah we can definitely still work on stuff together but i might have other random things to do this weekend (things like mailing shoes, random emails and contacting people which i’ve been putting off)
me: Yeah I have no idea! I think all you have to know is “I da mamma” and “I da baby”
budy: but we can definitely do like a fun work time if you are fine with focusing and doing kinda boring stuff 
budy: maybe we can do this on saturday or something we shall see
me: I think struggling with the project helped, tho, I made so many components I have it down now
budy: monday works for me! but feel free to do it separately if that is easier!
budy: (after thanksgiving)
budy: makes sense!
budy: what are you up to tonight?
budy: ￼
me: I see you? (Icy ewe?)
budy: hmm didn’t work
me: Haha yeah I won’t help you contact the people you’ve been putting off, don’t worry ;)
budy: will have to keep thinking 
me: But yeah! I’d love a sorta boring fun work stuff weekend!
me: Oh that’s dumb I went to the site, try just ICU instead lol
me: Yeah Saturday would be good. Andrew is super set on going to see Fantastic Beasts Friday too with Sowmya. Do you want to all four of us go?
budy: that’s it
me: Alex told me that we can get checked off for the dev part after doing just part 1, so we don’t have to do the foundation build to get checked off. So Monday works fine! I was worried we wouldn’t have time!
me: I was wronged
me: Tonight I am probably going to be on the phone most of the evening. So nothing too crazy.
me: Well, I still count that as being one I knew ;)
me: How about you? Also how was the test? :D
me: Have you not done Clarity yet? I see you have a thing on your calendar just called “register for clarity data model class!!!!!!!!!!!!”
budy: it was just a reminder to register for another class after i finish the exam
budy: haha
me: 😣 I thought for a second I was catching up to you. Vidya!
me: I guess we’ll still probably both finish reporting in January. We’re limited by one of the Advanced MyChart Reporting classes.
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: want to walk over to voyager?
me: Yup!
me: More tacos for dinner? Those looked really good! I’d love to have another family dinner with you and Sowmya sometime soon!
budy: yeah we will have to do it sometime!
me: What are you up to Vidya? What is on your mind?
budy: nothing much
budy: what are you up to?
me: Literally nothing :|
me: This was a while ago now, but at the Corporate Philosophy thing, when Judy asked why we are here doing this job... what did you say?
budy: what were the options again?
budy: what did you say 
me: I think it was like... for the customer, for epic’s mission, for the money, or just a thing to do. There’s one more though...
me: I said for epic’s mission, like, it’s important to me that I do something with some sort of social good (do you think Epic is that?). But I sometimes feel like I just have nothing better to do haha
budy: hmmm i actually remember it was “something interesting to do”
budy: i would be between that and money
budy: i do like epics mission though, which is why i chose it, but i don’t know that i am really doing it for social good unfortunately 
budy: in deep reflection and pondering?
me: I think that’s where I’m at now. I mean, this was the only job I got so it’s just a thing to do
me: Keep me off the streets.
me: But I guess I want to do something that makes peoples lives better. Maybe that’s “dreamy and unrealistic” like that strengths thing said 🤔
me: It’s ok to just do something for the sake of something to do. 
me: And yes haha, that’s my default state
budy: yeah i think it’s good to do good!
budy: i definitely find myself to be a realistic person but open minded i guess
budy: it’s good to dream and ponder though, definitely not a bad thing i think
me: Good is good most of the time
me: But not always from every perspective I guess
me: I guess we finally found some way in which we are different! That’s kind of exciting!
me: It’s good to be realistic. I feel out of touch with the way the world really works. Maybe that’s why I always try to write about or draw or program the world in a different way.
me: But see I tend to get lost in it
me: So I fear sometimes that I’ll never be relevant in this world
me: Haha 😅 sorry for rambling, this is why I shouldn’t do deep reflection and pondering! 
me: We only have 4 more weekends where we are both here, and Zach might come for one of those! Our random stuff weekends are fun, but I guess they do distract from projects! You know I’d love doing non-work work with you more haha
budy: yeah 
budy: lol relevant 
budy: ￼
budy: let me know what we need to do to get the ts skills for dev and release scheduled
budy: how was escalating?
me: Wow very wise words. Thanks Albert Einstein!
me: I can also let you just work on stuff alone, but I just thought you’d like a friend!
me: So I was looking at times for that, it looks like there are no good times with both of us next week :/ either we wait for the week after or do it separately. If we do the Monday after thanksgiving could we still finish the ts skills project this month?
me: Escalating was good! Turns out the 30 minute call can also be done together! That’s a little clearer now.
me: Good luck on your test! (You’re probably already in it, sorry!)
budy: sure i’d like to see fantastic beasts!
budy: sounds like a fun evening!
budy: the test was no good but oh well oh well i definitely studied this time around but it was quite long
budy: and sounds like a plan regarding ts skills!
budy: that’s good we don’t have to do build
budy: should we see if anyone else wants to watch the movie and did they already reserve tickets/should we be booking some?
me: Hey! Sorry I’m no good at multitasking. But cool! Should be a very fun evening! Yeah we could ask the group chat. And I will ask Andrew about if he’s getting tickets now.
me: Oh no 😨 jeez this must be a very hard test! Seemed pretty hard. I’m sorry, Vidya. I know you’ll get it next time though!
budy: are you guys still thinking of seeing fantastic beasts?
me: You’re super smart and I think you pick up on things very quickly. I have no doubt that you’ll succeed
me: I feel like I have a hard time learning this reporting stuff in a class. Like, everything I learned about cogito I got by myself on the project
me: What have you been up to this evening?
budy: no worries! you are probably 
budy: yikes
budy: you are probably one of the quickest responders honestly 
budy: i just cooked, did laundry and dishes and called my friend to catch up! it was nice 
budy: im feeling tired already though
budy: honestly i can’t bring myself to care about the tests too much and it’s probably not a good thing oh well
budy: how’s your evening been?
me: You’re very clever and very willing to just take action. I think that if I were trapped on a desert island, I’d want to be with you haha
me: That sounds like a nice evening! You did your dishes! Wow! I... did not :(
me: Such a good adult
me: Yeah, after like the first month the tests have just seemed so silly and pointless.
me: My evening has been alright. I dunno. I don’t like the phone. And I guess everyone just ended up a little upset. Not ideal, but about how it goes :\
me: Hope your call went better! Seems like you and your friends are better at phone calling!
budy: that’s nice to say, i don’t think i would be very useful on a desert island you should probably find some more crafty survivalistic friends
budy: such a great adult? hmmm
budy: yeah the phone can be difficult, i’m sorry it wasn’t a great call! 
budy: i guess im used to keeping in touch remotely due to having moved a lot (although admittedly i don’t think im the best) and also just missing some of my college friends
budy: but i totally understand not liking the phone, it’s too bad we have a job where we hve to make so many
budy: and i feel like having serious conversations can be tricky at any point and the phone can sometimes make it even harder idk
budy: but anyways i think you’re not terrible at it! you definitely helped me out when i was scared so you are definitely a better phone caller friend than you think
budy: ^sorry looks like i’ve caught the ramble
me: Well, I’d have fun trapped on an island with you at any rate haha
me: We will figure out how to be good adults at some point.
me: Yeah, it’s ok. I’m not too thrilled about having to make a bunch of phone calls. Even to my analysts or anyone I feel like I fail to communicate my message
me: I can be like that in person too though haha
me: That’s a good point about you having to move so much. It’s odd, like, I definitely struggle really hard to be a good friend over any amount of distance. Oh well.
me: And yeah, it’s hard to have serious conversations. I’m not really good at it. I think I give up quickly when I think I might make someone sad
me: Haha I’m glad! I have been told that I have a calming voice: in my service club I was voted most likely to narrate a nature documentary. I dunno, I don’t like my voice, but no one does
me: I like listening to you ramble :)
budy: communicating is hard...
budy: yeah i don’t think many people like the sound of their voice i definitely don’t 
budy: this week went by really fast!
budy: lets do earlier since it’s a long movie 
budy: also relistened to yung gravys song cheryl which might have been his romantic song
budy: and it’s terrible but the chorus is catchy
budy: “juice sauce a little bit of dressing ice wrist a little bit of flexing@
budy: “i went to the store for some chocolate flavored milk”
budy: same price?
budy: i’m fine with either seats definitely look better at flix
budy: sounds good 
budy: that would be great!
me: Yeah it’s hard! You have to, like, translate stuff from ideas to words and then the other person has to translate them back to ideas!
me: I feel like ideas in my head are not indexed well to be able to put them into words
me: Your voice is nice though, don’t worry!
me: This week was pretty fast! You weren’t even here one of the days!
me: Hahaha that’s such a good song! “I was thinking bout that masterpiece by R Kelly” lol
me: Too romantic though, it’s good we got out of there in time.
budy: okeh 👌 
budy: “juice sauce a little bit of dressing ice wrist a little bit of flexing”
budy: truly a masterpiece
budy: yeah we were definitely lucky
budy: yay!!!!
budy: 😡
budy: evan nooo
budy: 🔒 
budy: good one
budy: but also 
budy: terrible 
me: He has juice, sauce, dressing, and gravy? He’s monopolizing the entire edible non-water liquid industry.
me: Haha I’m glad you liked it m
me: That was just the first thing that popped into my mind lol
budy: oh gravy
budy: you are 🧠 being brainwashed my friend 
budy: i am too dont worry
budy: hooray 😎
budy: except 👎 to evan
budy: hmm evan what i do about mini golf...
me: Oh no! They are taking over my mind-Chronicles!
me: Oh yeah hahahahahahahaha
budy: lol definitely don’t tell anyone about this ok
me: Did Jesse ask you again?
me: Haha ok!
me: I promise.
budy: thanks, it would be weird if he found out i was telling you about this
budy: confiding in you here!
me: Yeah? What happened?
budy: well the latest is i think he wants to go mini golfing
me: Ok yes. True
budy: lol do you want to go
budy: i think it would might possibly be fun
me: Yeah! I think that would be fun!
me: I get the sense you are withholding something
me: But it would be fun for sure!
budy: i don’t really know i’m kinda bad at judging text messages, but i’ll tell you bout it later
budy: seems like a friendly hangout so we shall see
me: Haha yeah it’s hard to judge sometimes.
me: I am excited to hear more!
budy: i still kinda want to do work on saturday though if you are still down
me: But if you want my take: I already told you... I think Jesse may want it to be a more-than-friendly hangout haha
budy: we can make dinner and use up my leftovers!
me: And yes! I would love to do work on Saturday
me: So cool
me: Make some cauliflower stuff!
budy: well i’m glad we have friendly hangouts! i’m very thankful for you :)
budy: i can’t really tell honestly, what makes you think that
budy: i really want to know your reasoning, definitely trust your opinion on this 
me: Texting at 1 am to ask what you are doing is kind of suspicious. Like it means you’re on his mind a lot. Like, you two don’t hang out as friends (other than that one time) but he keeps inviting you to stuff.
me: That might totally not be true haha
me: What did you want to tell me about his texts? I’m missing the context!
budy: nothing super interesting but he was also going to see fantastic beasts tomorrow at marcus point and was just asking what i was doing this weekend
budy: just pretty normal honestly 
me: Gotcha. I mean, I’m like partially messing with you but also kinda not.
budy: i’m pretty sure he’s just trying to be nice and invite along 
budy: i think he’s nice so i’m gonna just assume that whatever 
budy: oh well oh well
me: It does seem like it goes beyond just being nice as a mentor. He really wants to get to know you.
me: When you say oh well oh well... you’re disappointed that maybe he’s just being nice?
budy: nooo, just that we both should probably stop over analyzing it
budy: (we are probably both the type to do that haha)
budy: but thanks for your thoughts, i appreciate it
me: Haha yeah we should. Yeah, both of us probably really would read too far into it!
budy: although i guess i sort of asked you to analyze... i’m sorry haha
me: Of course! I told you that from the moment he texted you last weekend!
me: Don’t worry! I really am deeply curious about this!
budy: also been meaning to ask you
budy: how’s your plant
me: Oh! I should water it. Good though!
me: I should set a calendar reminder to water it.
budy: who would do that!??
budy: silly
budy: you are way better at remembering things probably 
me: No I’d absolutely forget.
me: Before you completely change the subject: thanks for the good gossip haha I guess Emily’s friends didn’t tell Jesse that we are dating. Am I going to have to fight Jesse now?
me: At least take him on in mini golf.
me: We should actually, non-speculatively, play mini golf tho
budy: i will stick my belief that it is completely normal to have friends of the opposite gender
budy: i thought my subject change worked...
budy: friendly hangout no fight!
budy: also have you been watering chlorophyllip?
me: Yeah, it is completely normal... I think it’s dumb that if people of the opposite gender want to be friends the assumption is that it has to be romantic. I guess suggesting that was Jesse’s intention is kinda hypocritical of that though.... Sorry
me: I watered chlorophillip just this morning! Emily reminded me haha
me: I really should set a calendar reminder for that....
me: Hey it looks like the best time for the dev cycle meeting would be during your “stc stuff!” block... is it ok to move that?
budy: yeah that’s fine!
budy: thanks for scheduling 
budy: how’s the day going?
budy: yo are you doing anything 
budy: i might beed some help with customizations if you have time 
me: Nope! I would be happy to help you! :D
me: Want me to go to your office?
budy: ye
budy: thanks for the help!
me: Of course :) hope I helped a little! I don’t remember where that part of the login page is😬
budy: apparently i should actually edit dispayconfig.xml
budy: and add a node there
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: Oh jeez! DisplayConfig is scary.
me: I’m trying to update that one now- that’s the only file I didn’t do the look and feel for...
me: It’s proving to be very difficult to update.
budy: ಠ_ಠ
budy: ◕‸◕
budy: do you know how to create an internal slg
me: Why u sad ◕‸◕
me: Yes! Just make it in emc2 and don’t check show to customer
me: Or something like that
me: Allie helped me update DisplayConfig. It’s not that scary actually
budy: yay
budy: are you still here
me: I am indeed. I was logging time but I think I might put it off longer
budy: do it!!!
me: What are you doing? Still here too?
budy: yeah...
me: Well, what are you doing?
budy: on my way
budy: >:D
budy: we are here
me: Thanks for hanging out! We watched so much wizard stuff!
me: Honestly, movies kind of drive me crazy sometimes, I just feel so bored like I want to do something haha don’t tell Andrew!
me: It’s fun sometimes but overall I’d rather just talk. I guess you and I could just sneak away to like the star bar downstairs haha
budy: honestly same
budy: lol glad we had a good discussion though
budy: even if no one cares about it 😢
budy: star bar lol
me: Haha yeah it was fun to talk through the entire thing lol
budy: it was!
me: No one cares about our conversation? Haha
me: Yeah we aren’t special.
me: I think you’re more interesting than Harry Potter
budy: no, definitely not true
budy: harry potter is the chosen one
me: Hi Harry!
me: Yeah he’s pretty cool but you’re ok too.
me: Well, it was nice. Maybe we can just let Sowmya and Andrew watch stuff and we ditch them sometimes. But yeah! Try to get some rest, and I’d love to hang out tomorrow :D
me: It snowed! ⛄️ shall we start the day, Vidya?
budy: snow! im still sleeeeepy though
budy: also this might be slightly changing plans but how do you feel about getting dinner somewhere instead of making?
budy: like somewhere in west madison? there are a lot of good places!
me: Ok that would be nice!
me: There’s still a lot of time until dinner haha so we could do work also. I know you want to start some sort of project. Totally up to you!
budy: what is your plan for the day?
me: I’ll probably do non work work no matter what haha
me: Do you have a plan for the day?
budy: i guess potential plan:
-meet up here ~6
-go eat
-do nw work at my house in night
budy: just have a bunch of stuff to do, we will see if i get to a project 
budy: we can also meet up later than 6
budy: like 7 or something 
budy: (we will decide the time later how does that sound?)
me: Ok! Sounds lovely!
me: Yeah that’s fair. I guess I have stuff I should do too. I should go get a haircut!
me: We will decide on a time later!
me: Hey Vidya, how is the stuff going? What are you up to?
budy: honestly somehow got back to sleeping
budy: i guess i kinda still need it for recovering or whatever
budy: what have you been up to?
me: That’s good to do after being sick! Totally understandable!
me: After a week of work all I want is sleep haha
budy: do you want to maybe work together tomorrow instead like during the day
me: I got a haircut! That’s all I did today.
budy: that’s nice!
me: We could do that if you’d rather! It’s up to you, I’d love to hang out but I want you to do whatever you need to also
budy: i’m somehow more exhausted than i thought 
budy: sorry :(
budy: is there anything you want to do?
budy: maybe we can still get dinner tonight or something?
me: That’s ok! Don’t worry! You’ve had a long week! Yeah there’s not really anything I want to do but dinner could be nice!
budy: i feel really bad!
me: Why? Don’t!
me: Spending time together is about us feeling happy! If you’re tired, I’d rather you just rest and feel better, right? Because I care about you!
me: I value you as a person, not as a source of entertainment for me :)
me: What would make you happiest?
budy: i value you too! i would still like to meet up so maybe dinner would be good
budy: what do you think?
me: That sounds great :) maybe around 6-7 still?
budy: ok! is there anything you want to eat?
me: Nothing in particular! Is there anything you want? We could still go someplace near you
budy: hmm i’m kinda feeling like ramen? i guess there are more of those downtown
me: That sounds good! Yeah we can absolutely go someplace downtown!
budy: or noodles?
budy: ok yeah!
me: Great! Let’s do that :D
me: You could come to my apartment and then we can drive someplace from there so we only need to park one car?
budy: ok
me: We could just meet someplace too. Is there a place you had in mind?
budy: places that look good:
-umami
-morris ramen 
-ha long bay
budy: jerry was talking about ramen yesterday and i think he mentioned umami
budy: i’ll pick you up definitely easier 
me: Yeah I think I have heard Jerry talk about umami. Want to go there?
me: And ok that would be good!
budy: ok sounds like a plan 
budy: and for time ~6:45-7 probably
me: Sounds great! I will see you then!
budy: :)
me: I just saw myself in the mirror; it’s been like 4 months since I got a haircut and I’m not used to how I look now 😮 haha
budy: lol it happens! look forward to seeing it
me: I think I like it a little longer than it is now, but that’s ok, it grows pretty fast.
budy: forgot about snow on car
budy: ill let you know eta soon
me: Oh yeah 🤔 no problem! Let me know!
me: Stay warm!
budy: should be around 7:15!
budy: here
me: Ok! I’ll be out in a second!
me: Sorry! I didn’t want to kick you out! You can stay as long as you want! You can just let me know when you’re awake :)
budy: yeah i’m done/ready 
budy: sorry!
me: Ugh, now I’ve just been sleeping all day....
me: How was Costco?
me: Have fun at mini golf!
me: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npZp3H1NrdE
me: Here’s a vine to get you in the spirit of hanging out with Jesse
budy: costco was good! i did my laundry and dishes! hope your sleep was good
budy: thanks! everything will be ok hooray
budy: what else are you up to?
me: Nice! You’re a good adult. Yeah I’ve been cleaning things too.
me: Everything will be ok! I don’t know Jesse’s motives but he is a good guy.
me: Now I’m just working on non-work work
budy: thank you necks
budy: oh cool! your game?
me: Yup. Making it so I can specify random things to show up in chests. Kinda fun.
me: I went to the store for some chocolate flavored milk
me: (I need to go to the store too, but for actual food. I have none)
budy: get the food!
budy: go to the store!!!
me: I did jeez!
me: How was mini golf?
budy: it was good, i’m back home now!
budy: good job
me: Thanks dad
me: It was good? Any more details?
budy: it was just a quick friendly hangout, nothing too much beyond that
budy: how was the store?
budy: any details?
me: You seem annoyed, I’ll stop prying. Sorry for being suspicious. Glad you had fun!
me: The store was good, nothing much to report.
me: What are you up to the rest of the evening?
budy: no not annoyed but honestly nothing much happened 
budy: folding clothes and cooking for the weej
budy: and then who knows???
budy: what about you?
me: Well, did you like mini golf? We need to find more indoor things to do. I ran out weeks ago!
me: That sounds fun folding clothes. Then you could think of a project. Thinking of, I’ll send you the book charts!
me: I have been really lazy today sleeping a lot... I should do something but don’t have much motivation.
me: ￼That’s weird, some random person just liked my Venmo payment to you
budy: that’s my mom...
budy: hmmm
budy: lazy sundays happen though 
budy: yeah definitely send them!
me: Oh lmao guess your mom is glad you got ramen
me: Sometimes you just need sleep ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: ￼￼￼￼
me: Some plots!
me: (Why are the red and green bars upside down on Frankenstein?)
budy: what do those represent again?
me: So the white line is like cumulative “happiness” of the words used. So like if a point on the line is above zero, that means that up to that point in the story, there were more positive words used than negative ones. The red and green bars are basically like the slope for the chapter overall. Like green means that chapter had more happy words and red means it had more negative words.
me: (The graph doesn’t do a good job of explaining itself haha, how do you think this data could be represented in a more self-obvious way?)
budy: aaah i see! i forgot that’s what it was
budy: i think it’s pretty cool!
budy: so sentimental 😢
me: That big drop in Alice makes me cry every time 😢 any ideas on how to make a poster with that? How could it be presented better?
budy: honestly i like it! it really reminds me of stocks and stuff 
budy: https://www.screenplays-online.de/
budy: curious as to what a screenplay would look like
budy: https://www.screenplays-online.de/screenplay.php/111
budy: https://www.screenplays-online.de/screenplay.php/26
budy: these seem to be plain text?
budy: https://www.screenplays-online.de/screenplay.php/16
budy: http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/lilo-and-stitch-script-transcript.html
budy: haha idk just curious ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: ￼
me: No thats a good idea!
me: It would be cool to draw in parts of the story to correspond with the graph
budy: ^it looks like my other links didn’t send the right ones
budy: oops
me: Or to fill in the area with the dominant color on the screen at that point in the movie
budy: yeah those both sound cool!
me: (would be harder to screen print)
budy: that’s so cool though
budy: it got so happy 
me: Yeah! It ended on a very positive note
me: If you look on the website, they transcribed the entire “Burning Love” song at the end of the script haha I had to delete that because that ended up being a huge spike!
budy: http://www.hogwartsishere.com/library/book/7391/chapter/1/
budy: lol i saw that
budy: it was like the whole end credit song too
me: ￼Oh no!
me: Just steadily declines until the very end, huh?
budy: aww
me: Ooh! Yeah definitely have to do harry potter
budy: angsty teenz
me: Those angsty teenz
budy: yeah harry potter!
me: See, the red and green bars aren’t there because there are no clear chapter delimiters. So it could be filled in with anything!
budy: i see...
me: Lol it lists “Jesus” as the author of harry potter
me: ￼Ooh this is a good one! You can very clearly see the rising action, the climax, and resolution to the story.
me: What would be interesting is to use this data lined up with the prominent color on the screen at the time and you could quantitatively figure out how a color “feels”
me: ￼The line is the Yule Ball scene. It’s one of the lowest points in the movie!
me: Have fun with the corporate visit! You doing good overall?
budy: tired aaah
budy: ￼???
budy: oh i get it now
me: Yeah Dean is leaving. I had a meeting with him and he dabbed, so he’s definitely a good match with David
me: You’re tired, oh no! I’m sorry :/
me: Hopefully you can just sorta chill in the corp visit.
me: Were you up late watching a bad movie last night?
me: Also when are you doing lunch?
budy: no, i went to bed early last night
budy: haha im just tired sometimes 
budy: this is interesting though 
budy: i think we do lunch here
budy: hows your day going so far
me: Going to bed early is good. I started watching a movie but didn’t get far because it was late. It was a dumb teen movie you said you liked haha I’m definitely a sucker for those, so I thought it was fantastic
me: I’m just tired sometimes too
me: Interesting! I’d love to hear all about it. Is mustache guy there?
me: My day is good. I’m learning about virtual care. Sitting in on a webcast on the other side of the q&a section 😮
budy: which movie???
budy: he is!
budy: this is a lot of virtual care too!
me: To All the Boys I Loved Before haha such a dumb teen rom-com but it’s funny
me: Wow mustache guy!
me: That’s neat. So it’s just a customer asking talking through features they might want to buy?
budy: i liked that one! it’s actually really nice and less dumb than most
budy: yeah pretty much 
budy: a lot of demo and questions 
me: I felt like I enjoyed it too much to just be watching it alone haha so in case you’d like to finish it with me
me: And you’re just sitting there watching them talk?
budy: yeah pretty much
budy: and eating food
budy: and taking some notes
budy: omg sherlock is not sherlock anymore
budy: 🕵️‍♂️ 
me: Sounds like a fun time! (Well, at least it’s a break from normal work!)
me: I know! They changed Sherlock! It has a new look and feel!
me: Thinking of, I’m going to email the guru dev people. I’ll include you too!
budy: yay ok
budy: i was actually coming up with ideas in the corp visit!
me: Wow! Any good ideas?
budy: ^do you guys still want to do this?
budy: (tomorrow)
budy: we’ll have to do it another time then!
me: I think we could still find something else to do tomorrow.
me: We won’t see each other for like 4 days which is entirely too long haha
budy: trivia?
me: That’d be fun. Do you want to?
budy: hmm maybe
budy: if ya need to pack thats cool too
budy: might just relax
me: Packing doesn’t take long at all so don’t worry about that
me: It’d be nice to spend time together but if you just want to relax that’s fine too
budy: let’s make tacos tomorrow then
me: That sounds lovely!
me: Do you want to do that?
me: What are you up to?
budy: ya! sowmya’s down
budy: i’ll see if anyone else is interested too
budy: i’m making red curry noodles
me: Great! It’ll be a mini Friendsgiving but with tacos
me: That’s exciting. Sounds good.
me: Are those red things? You could take it to Davis’s thing
budy: you are right!
budy: they are red
budy: i hope they turn out cood
budy: good
me: I’m sure it’ll be good I have faith!
me: Are you going to make something for Davis?
me: Once again I guess it’s only you me and Sowmya who want to do stuff tomorrow haha
me: That’s ok! We will have fun
me: I finished that movie, it was so sweet!
budy: it was, wasn’t it?
budy: we can just do right after work then if it’s just us
me: It seemed to suggest that sometime love just comes down to how much time you spend with another person🤔
budy: thanks for coming over and making tacos and eating them! i’m glad you came and we did end up doing it after all
me: My sources say you’ve been in meetings all morning. How has that been?
budy: this might be disappointing but honestly i have a lot of work, do you think it would be ok if we cancel taco party :(
budy: ill see if i get farther but it’s not looking good 
budy: and my day tomorrow is blergh
me: Well, that’s ok. I’d rather you are feeling happy with work than eat tacos!
me: You can let me know, I mean, if you’re working late, maybe we could just get Cass dinner together haha
me: The effect would be the same :)
budy: i mistook david again 
budy: oh no
budy: ooooo no
budy: it wasn’t david but it looked just like him 
me: ooooo noooo! Not all white people look the same, Vidya!
me: Do you need help with anything? Honestly I’m like super not busy so I feel bad
budy: i was wearing my glasses too
budy: i guess i need better glasses
me: Maybe you look so serious with your glasses because you still can’t see.
me: ￼Just got STC certified!
me: How’s it going Vidya?
budy: omg congratzzz
budy: aaah did a lot of stuff
budy: but still more to do
budy: and an ambulatory ts just called me to look at a new thing
budy: aah
budy: how do you open app menu from lookitt again
budy: like d ^e or d^wp
budy: im blanking
budy: want to still do tacos
budy: i don’t want to work anymore 
me: Haha well, I would love to still do tacos if you don’t want to work :)
budy: i do have to call someone at ~8/8:30 tho
budy: but yeh!
me: Ok! Yeah that would be lovely!
me: Just come by my office when you’re ready to leave!
budy: are you ready?
budy: i have a question im coming 
me: Yeah! Thanks for having me. It was really nice! It’s a lot of fun to make dinner with you :D
me: I’m going to miss you over the next few days! You’ll have a fun “thanksgiving break” though!
budy: i bet you’ll have a great time! i will definitely enjoy the time :)
budy: what else you been up to?
me: ￼I can’t seem to decide where the eyes should go on this sprite. Like I think this looks best but if you notice, it’s lopsided: three pixels on the left and two on the right. It just looks either too far apart or too close otherwise! Ugh it’s a problem. I need your artistic insight. (Also don’t mind the clothes or skin tone, I drew those on just so you wouldn’t think I was drawing a naked bald person.)
me: I need to pack tho.
me: How was your meeting? ;)
budy: so cute!
budy: i think it looks nice :)
budy: pack!
budy: twas a good call, ya know how scary those can be
budy: but it was one of the good ones so exciting 
budy: i am a fan of plainPants.png
me: It might be really obvious that it’s lopsided in the game.... The Pokémon sprites are an odd number of pixels wide 😮
me: That’s good! Did you have your advisor on the call?
me: Jk... no that is good to hear, I’m glad. It’s stressful sometimes.
me: plainPants.png is a good name!
me: You are an observant little one aren’t you?😈
budy: my call ended early!
budy: want to get gelato
me: Wow! I would like nothing more!
budy: there are 8 new tech notes since yesterday :o
me: Geez! That’s so many! I guess upgrading does that....
me: I’m sure you’ll pull through.
me: Thanks for getting gelato with me! That probably helped.
me: You’ve made my time in Madison very enjoyable, so you’re important to me and I’m thankful for you :)
budy: yeah! it was so good 
budy: i feel like it had honey in it 
me: You really like honey, don’t you? It’s good! Those bees are smart.
me: Haha Brett is very thorough
budy: reeaaaally
budy: hows the search
budy: also when are you leaving 
me: How are you, Vidya? I’m almost to the airport! I might have time to go to Frontera, the airport restaurant Jerry says is amazing! I’ve been thinking about that the whole way, I’m so excited!
me: What are you up to? Started doing nothing yet?
budy: wow!
budy: you’ll have to tell me how it is!
budy: by doing nothing i will definitely do something at home >:D
budy: i went grocery shopping and stuff so got the cranberry sauce stuff
budy: but gave up in finding the stuffing, i honestly couldn’t find it anywhere 
budy: oh weeeeell
me: I got a torta at Frontera, it was so good! 
me: But... it had this salsa with it and I made the horrible mistake of thinking airport food wouldn’t be spicy so I just dipped a lot of it in my first bite...
me: That’s seriously like one of the spiciest things I’ve ever had! Oof oh my god it made my cry
me: (Add it to the list with Coco and Lilo and Stitch)
me: Sounds like a fun mid-day weekend so far! You’ll find something to do!
me: You got the red things that’s all that matters.
budy: aww thanks friend, i’m very thankful to you too and am glad to know you! happy thanksgiving 
me: How has your day been? What did you do?
budy: it’s been good! nothing huge but it was very comfy and relaxing 
budy: painted a little
budy: then moved the couch close to the fireplace and was reading and on the computer and it’s very nice and warm! napped a few times because it’s so comfy
budy: and i got gifts for my family online hooray
budy: i have never felt more like a cat before haha
budy: also had indomie mi goreng for dinner (the indonesian insyant noodles) and they were good
budy: although i’ll probably get hungry and eat the leftover tacos soon
budy: how’s denver and home been? what are you up to?
me: That sounds like a fantastic day!
me: Moving the couch is brilliant! You really were like a cat
me: I really wish I had a fireplace so that I could do that. Maybe I’ll have to use yours.
me: I also want to try those Indonesian instant noodles
me: My day was nice, I... actually didn’t have thanksgiving dinner with my family. Katrina was upset that I wasn’t going to her family’s thanksgiving so I went there instead. I think my family was annoyed by that.... she can be funny like that sometimes, but it was still good.
me: I had dessert with my family! Denver is good: a couple times I’ve walked outside and been like... wow it’s really warm.
me: (It’s like 10°C)
me: Sorry I was busy and didn’t text you, how was the rest of your day? Is work super empty? Being productive?
budy: no worries about it have a great rest of the weekend! it’s actually pretty warm here too: 8 deg c!
budy: i’m working on stc rn but yes it is peaceful
budy: for debugging what do you think is the best strategy for submitting?
budy: just be very detailed in the 15 you submit?
budy: https://youtu.be/MZIuIMij6XY
budy: ^also here’s another silly song of the day 
me: That’s pretty warm! :,( it’s sad how our standards have fallen
me: Cool! Yeah for STC, definitely be very thorough with the descriptions. Don’t submit until you’re like 100% sure you have 10 good ones.
me: (Otherwise you won’t get hints and have to struggle for a bunch more)
me: That sounds nice to be there when it’s so empty! Did you get pizza with Tom?
me: So you’re back into meme rap, huh? I definitely have to watch this song! I will later tonight!
budy: yeah i went to the pizza thing and it was nice
budy: I look like a mom in my CR-V
Flexin' on your friends in my CR-V
Got like 5 seats in my CR-V
For my whole crew in my CR-V
budy: classic.
me: Absolute classic
me: ￼
me: I’m helping with my dad at a Christmas tree lot! Sowmya would be excited
me: Ugh Vidya, this break has been really hard for me. I’m upset and everyone is mad at me and I don’t know what to do :(
me: Maybe we can talk this coming week or something.
me: What are you up to? Hope you’re having a good weekend!
budy: 🎄 
budy: yeah we can definitely talk through it when you get back, hope you feel better though!
budy: i’ve been doing a lot of stuff i’ve been putting off which is good and gonna start making something for the potluck
me: Thanks Vidya! You’re a good friend. I am feeling better, but I guess I’d still like to talk sometime.
me: I am at the airport on my way back to Madison! It’s been good to be back for a bit but I think Madison feels more like home at the moment!
me: How was the potluck?
me: More importantly... how was Davis’s place lol
budy: it was actually really nice! they made so much food and it was all pretty good
budy: we just ate, talked and played on their switch
budy: i’ll see you tomorrow!
me: I’m back in Madison!
me: That sounds like a fun time! Who all was there?
me: Do anything interesting today?
budy: davis, jason, craig (jason’s friend), axle (craig’s friend), david, me
budy: nothing much, finally hung some stuff up and just reading 
budy: gotta clean and put the furniture back before sowmya gets back
me: Cool! Sounds like a good crowd. I’ll have to hear more about the specifics!
me: That’s good! Do your posters bring you joy? Do your new wall decorations make your room a more comfortable place to be?
me: Haha I dunno, it sounds like your couch placement is pretty great, you get to be a cat!
me: So you had a good weekend overall?
budy: yeah i think it’s more pleasant and will encourage me to spend more time not sleeping/lazing around and doing something more productive haha
budy: yeah... but i feel like she might not like it...
budy: i think it was pretty good! not too eventful but got some things done
budy: what are you up to?
budy: also did you come through chicago?
me: Good! Sleeping is nice but not all the time. It will fight away the seasonal depression!
me: Getting things done is good! Glad you had a good day.
me: I’m just trying to get caught up on stuff. Nothing too exciting.
me: I flew straight into Madison this time, which is good. Heard it’s snowing really hard in Chicago!
me: It looks like next weekend is snowy here too :| we can make snow men though! :D
budy: i see i see
budy: ready for ts skills tomorrow?
budy: i have to do work on my answers to questions in the morning 
budy: yeah i heard that too! did andrew get back?
budy: yay snow men
me: I have not really looked at the ts skills stuff at all.... should we split it up and focus on certain parts?
budy: yeah!
budy: do su basics delivering sus and odds and ends
me: Hey come here one second
budy: let’s try to get them done by 9:30 and then we can review our answers then
budy: ok
budy: 
budy: 
budy: gonna need until like 9:43 probably
me: I wonder too.... we can try to figure it out.
me: If you need a ride to work tomorrow and Sowmya can’t, I’d be happy to help!
budy: hey are you still here my car is not working hmmm
budy: sowmyas here and she has cables!
budy: thanks though!
me: That’s good! I’m glad! Jeez! Did you get it started?
budy: it’s not working :,(
budy: maybe you could take a look at it tomorrow
me: Oh no :( ok, yeah, we can try it tomorrow. For now I guess you can just go with Sowmya...
budy: we are gonna call tomorrow if so
me: Call tomorrow if we can’t fix it?
budy: yeah 
me: Ok, yeah we can try to technical problem solve it tomorrow! Sorry it’s broken though, that’s annoying :(
budy: aww thanks!
budy: i wonder what it is...
budy: i think we will probably go together tomorrow but thanks for offering
budy: just got home
me: Sounds good, well, let me know if you need anything! If we look at your car after work tomorrow we can plan on me driving you back
me: That’s so sad it took so long to get home! :(
me: Hopefully your lamp and wall decorations will make it feel better!
me: Jeez it’s gonna be so snowy this weekend! At least it sorta waited for December. I was going to ask what we should do this weekend, but I think snowy day stuff is the answer! (Which is fun!)
budy: yeah we shall have to see! hopefully my car is up and working by then and thanks for the help!
me: What are you up to?
budy: watching videos about dead cars 💀 
budy: are you good at jump starting cars
me: Oh! Well you will be an expert.
me: Yes! Red on dead
budy: i have a feeling we somehow did it wrong 
budy: yeah we did that hmm
me: Ok, well we will try it. You sometimes just have to let it sit for a while.
budy: i really hope i don’t have to call someone 
me: Hopefully we can figure it out!
me: Watch enough videos and you’ll be very well prepared
budy: i’m thinking i need to try finding a better ground to connect to and make sure to connect it better to the red terminal on my car (it wasn’t clipping on very well so maybe the connection was loose idk)
budy: anyways i’ll hope for the best
budy: what are you up to 
budy: also anyways i’m thankful to know lovely people like sowmya and you who are willing to help me out so thanks!!!
me: Hmm... well we will certainly try all of those things! I don’t really know much about cars actually...
me: I am not really doing much. I took a bath. It was very relaxing. I haven’t had a bathtub for four years!
me: Of course! Although... I have not done anything to help yet! You are a very good friend too, and I know you’d try to help me! You’d probably be the first person I’d call, really.
me: You rused me 😈
budy: just got here 
me: Ok! I’m almost there
me: One sec!
budy: i’m inside
me: Ok
me: I’m here... I don’t see you
budy: thanks again for fixing my car! and coming to chickfila!
budy: it has been said but grateful to know you
me: Of course! Thanks for listening to me also, I hope you know that I really trust you. I’m really grateful for you too... honestly I thought a lot about what to tell you. It was important to me because you have been the best part of living here, and thus, the hardest part of deciding to leave. But I’ll be your friend always so it’s ok! :D
budy: i don’t open up to many people and trust you a lot too, i think it’s good that you have made a decision and i’m excited to see what you will do and make!
budy: i’m feeling emotional suddenly
budy: we have this facebook group at rice which people post on and it makes me cry because i really feel their sadness sometimes
budy: maybe i’m just in a crying mood who knows 
me: It’s ok to cry, sometimes it can be really good!
budy: but i was feeling some type of way coming home and then i saw a post that someone i know posted today and
me: What are you looking at? What did someone post?
budy: 😢
me: What was it? It’s just a page for emotional support?
me: And hey, it’s ok... I don’t want you to be upset, but I guess I knew that maybe you’d be upset for various reasons
budy: it’s this group called rice university places i’ve cried
budy: oh no i’m not upset!
me: Places you’ve cried?! 😢
budy: but it was still a meaningful conversation and i appreciate your time
budy: yeah...
budy: basically a lot of people confess the places they have cried and when
budy: it really makes you feel less alone somehow
me: That’s very nice that people can open up like that.
budy: especially when you see posts you resonate with
me: And by having a specific purpose like listing places, it makes it easier to be honest with how you feel
me: I like that idea
budy: yeah it kinda just shows you that everyone cries and is going through some struggles 
budy: some posts are short, some longer
me: Yeah it’s good. Where was your friend crying?
budy: it was kind of a very long one
budy: here are some short ones 
budy: ￼￼￼
budy: these are shorter ones that don’t have anything too personal but idk
budy: ￼
budy: i guess it means a lot that people are brave and post these publicly 
budy: i think it really means a lot that people are willing to be that vulnerable and i greatly appreciate as i have a hard time doing that 
budy: but anyways maybe today is just one of those emotional days
me: Those are nice. They’re short but I think it’s just the act of saying it at all that is so valuable.
me: It’s very hard to open up and be honest with people. It is very brave that they can post there
budy: this is a part of the one i read today
budy: (when i got hone)
budy: home
budy: ￼
budy: ￼
me: That’s intense... that’s good that they were able to open up about it. They clearly had been thinking about this a lot, just evidenced by how well-written the post is.
me: I can definitely feel their sadness. It’s almost to the point where it’s more like apathy, being so tired of being sad that you don’t feel much at all. Or don’t want to.
me: What were they talking about?
budy: this is the end too
budy: ￼
budy: it was about how they hid their sadness for a long time about their family member’s death
budy: they graduated in may too 
me: Hmm I assumed it was the death of a family member. That’s really hard. It’s good they were able to talk about it. Sometimes that just takes time though.
me: They summed up the purpose of the page pretty nicely.
me: It’s really brave. I think this would have helped a lot of people at Mines too. I know a lot of people who had a really hard time and just boxed up a lot of very difficult feelings.
me: Are you ok, Vidya? I’m happy to listen if there’s something you want to share, ok?
budy: i’m alright, thanks for being my friend
me: I’m always here for you. It’s impossible to say what the future holds, but I’d be happy if you were a part of mine.
me: How is your small enclosed space?
me: Want to go to lunch?
budy: sure!
budy: if you’re still around 
budy: curious...
me: I have to give you SOME reason to want to talk to me
budy: 😬
me: 😬
me: Are you still here?
budy: yeah 
me: Me too. Let me know when you want to get dinner!
budy: ok
budy: you can also go too!
budy: don’t be obligated to wait
me: I would really like to wait!
budy: ok i’m good
budy: ￼😳
me: *HR smashes through your window*
me: It was odd, like he was telling me “we don’t want you to leave, you’ve done really well with training!” Maybe they’ll just be extra nice to me now
budy: ooh yeah!
budy: lol as david would say
budy: stealing all our bonuses
budy: how was the drive home?
budy: also i liked the cheese burger soup
me: Yeah, I thought you were the one stealing raises!
me: The drive home was good, snow here works very differently: I think it’s so cold it never sticks so it’s like dust on the road! In Denver it melts then refreezes so it’s all icy!
me: How was your first time driving in snow? Were you ok?
me: Also I’m so excited for this soup! Soup in the snow is good
budy: so dusty!
budy: my brakes were weird
budy: i went super slow 
me: Why were they weird? Did it feel like they were shaking?
me: Yeah it’s good to go slow!
me: I really don’t like snow driving, but this was really good as far as it goes!
budy: yeah shaking a bit
budy: but no stopping problems or anything 
budy: and it was cool how it just blew everywhere 
budy: but it is definitely slippery 
me: Yeah that’s probably the auto-lock breaking. It only kicks on if you start sliding!
me: Yeah, you just have to go really slow and not hit the breaks or the accelerator too hard.
me: Yeah! I’ve never seen snow that just blew around like that! It was very interesting! Kinda pretty!
budy: yeah!
budy: also just wanted to apologize for being so ~emotional~ yesterday haha
me: Hey, the whole point of that page is to be open about how you feel! So please don’t apologize for that! I promise to always listen to you when you are ~emotional~ ok? It makes me so glad to know that you are willing to open up to me!
me: Also thank you for listening to me! I feel heard when I’m with you, which is very special :)
budy: yeah i guess that’s true
budy: well i guess thank you for listening to me as well it does mean a lot
budy: i really like listening to what to you have to say
budy: what was that happiness feedback loop?
me: Oh, well I don’t usually have much to say, but thanks! :) I really like listening to what you have to say too
me: That, miss Giri, is classified information. I decided it doesn’t even work that way anyway so it’s an outdated drawing (and cryptic enough that you can’t figure out what it is by just looking at it)
me: What are you up to?
budy: ok i see... top secret!
budy: not much, similar to yesterday feeling thankful so i just messaged a friend to tell her she’s cool and i value her and then we talked a bit
budy: gonna read dune hooray
budy: and then sleeeeep
budy: but anyways maybe i’m still emotional but i just have been feeling like there’s never a good time to express how much you value a person and how it’s often left unsaid (at least for me as sometimes words are hard) 
me: That’s really nice to tell your friend you care! I think it’s often something that goes unsaid, but I don’t know why: if you care about someone, you should tell them.
me: Yeah, I am not good at that :/
me: There are a lot of people in my life that I really value, but they probably don’t even know.
me: I am not good at expressing it.
me: So it’s really good to tell your friend!
me: It’s... hard to say it sometimes. Often I feel like I get hung up in a conversation or something because there’s just something I want to tell the other person but can’t....
me: Is there something you feel like you need to tell someone but don’t know how to say it?
budy: (´༎ຶོρ༎ຶོ`)
budy: idk just one of those days
budy: expressing myself is one of many things that i am no good at but that’s ok because i’m trying i guess
budy: i guess like you said there are a lot of people you meet that will never know how much you appreciate them
budy: i really don’t know evan...
budy: sorry just a ramble
budy: how’s it going
budy: hope you catch the bus!
me: Hey! Don’t worry! And don’t say sorry! I say sorry a lot, but I know it’s not good!
me: I’m sure the people in your life know how you feel about them even if you aren’t good at saying it.
me: They said don’t set data with a zr zl, but they DIDN’T say not to use autoHotKey to make your computer automatically press the keys required to make a new contact on 107 different records in Chronicles! This way it’s just like creating it in text but being able to type really fast! No broken auditing!
me: It can be really hard to say!
me: ￼
me: But I really care about you. I have never quite met anyone that I connected with so quickly and so completely. You have made a big difference to me. Know that I really care about you, and I do know that you care about me too.
budy: nice!
budy: lol sorry for bothering you for so long! the autohotkey thing was cool!
me: Do you want to talk? I give you permission to call me any time, even at 3am because I value your happiness above my own wellbeing haha
me: Haha I wanted you to bother me :)
me: I took the bus this morning! Everyone is nice they all thank the bus driver haha
me: I need to figure out when the bus comes!
me: Oh also mustache guy was on the bus. I forgot to tell you that!
me: ￼This is absolutely going to get abused
me: Viidya, want to go to farmers market?
budy:  what are you doing there?
budy: ok!
budy: also did you figure the bus
me: Making a subset of all the questionnaires
me: ok!
me: Nope! I need to do that now
budy: ￼i did it
me: Next bus is 5:21.
me: :O and David hasn’t even cut his hair yet!
me: After that, 6. It’s pretty regular.
me: Did you actually make an SLG? Did you have the owners tab?
me: Also, I want to know, are you doing well? You have seemed upset the last few nights, if you want to do something or just talk, let me know! What would make you happy?
budy: just email 
budy: i know!
me: Oh man :/ I misread what my phone was telling me: it said to leave at 6 because it’s a 15 minute walk to Isis.... so I’m actually really early. Bus is in like 20 minutes!
budy: wait did you make 3 meetings with alex
me: No, he said just do one hour long one
budy: ahh ok
me: I’m proud of you!
me: ￼
me: I made a fake patient to test virtual care
me: Good. Just on the bus. Still no earbuds tho which is important for bus riding. How are you?
budy: lil jimbles!
budy: i see
budy: getting dinner at cass
budy: i’m good though, thanks for looking out for me
budy: just a weird mood i guess 
budy: you definitely need earbuds
me: That’s fun. You’ll be set for the whole weekend!
me: Of course. I’m glad you’re good. But that’s fair. Being in a weird mood is just sorta how I am most of the time
me: I feel lonely. But also like I want to be alone. Usually driving to and from work is enjoyable because I get to just be alone. Now there are people around.
budy: i see...
budy: yeah i don’t really know what’s wrong, i just keep having this feeling like i’m constantly making all these stupid decisions that waste time and are wasting everyone else’s time too, i feel like i’m constantly running out of time to do things and it’s all just whooshing bye
budy: i don’t know why i have this feeling of being under so much pressure as i literally have no reason to be and there’s definitely plenty of time left
budy: and i get the loneliness piece too
budy: it’s weird
budy: any particular reason for the loneliness on your end?
budy: ^but yeah as for what i was mentioning i am fine i think i’m just constantly feeling like i just want to lie down and ignore the world as it just whooshes past
budy: but i cannot became there’s too much to do, and time is short, everything ends sooner or later and you never know when that will be
budy: but overall it’s relatively silly to think this way as although things end, i guess it’s good to remember that things also begin too so that’s nice to keep in mind
budy: yay positive!
me: I know what you mean. Like, I really wish that time didn’t pass while I was sleeping. Like, that things would just happen when I am ready for them to happen. Instead everything is just always moving and getting closer and I feel like I have to move forward too. But I’d rather just lie here
me: That would be so nice to just lie down on a couch together for literal eternity.
me: It makes it worse now that I am trying to move. Like, I can’t just be content with where I am even.
me: So yeah, my source of loneliness is the same thing you are talking about. Maybe it’s not loneliness but just longing for something
me: It’s ok to feel that way.
budy: longing for something
me: But yes, as one thing ends another begins. It’s hard to be excited by that when you feel so apathetic, but it’s true, being alive means being dynamic and living in a changing world
me: So it’s ok.
me: Sometimes we can just sleep though.
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: Bought the GRE... December 20. Is that ok? I took a half day of vacation heh...
me: That’s about as much mental energy as I had, so now I might just lie in bed.
budy: oh nice!
budy: that’s good that you’ve set a date
budy: now you just have to prepare!
budy: what else are you up to today
me: Sorry, ugh, actually I have a huge headache... :( I think it’s basically just exhaustion.
me: I’m just lying down.
me: What are you up to?
budy: don’t be sorry! sometimes headaches happen? have you been sleeping ok lately?
budy: or exhausted for any particular reason?
budy: it’s good to lie down 
budy: trying to finish work
me: Haha I know, sorry for saying sorry ;)
me: I dunno, just stress-tired!
me: Plus had to get up earlier than normal for the bus
me: You are still working?
me: What are you working on?
budy: i couldn’t really get much work done because david came and then he convinced me to get food and then we ran into sowmya and then i just wanted to leave
budy: so i’m just starting stuff haahaaa
budy: stress tired happens, sometimes it happens 
budy: are you going to drive tomorrow
budy: working on debug so not too bad haha
budy: hey also thanks for saying you would answer at 3am, i totally would say the same except i miss calls a lot as i don’t have vibrate on and am a heavy sleeper
budy: but your wellbeing in worth a lot so don’t neglect that
me: Haha David is a profoundly distracting human being. Whenever he’s around I seriously just can’t focus.
me: But he’s entertaining
me: I’m sure you’ll get it! That’s why scheduling a vso for yourself is such a good idea!
me: I think I will drive tomorrow. I just wanted to practice the bus haha
me: And of course! I think that’s my problem a lot of the time: I don’t value my own wellbeing very much but I do really care about others’ wellbeing. I’m happy with it that way though.
me: I won’t be too offended if you don’t answer your phone at 3am haha I am a very light sleeper!
budy: he’s too entertaining, it’s quite impressive honestly
budy: yeah oh well i’ll figure it out
budy: well you’re wellbeing is important!
budy: yeah i would definitely do so if i was awake and saw it!
me: I just have to go to bed I think...
me: Hey, also, you said you felt like you were just wasting everyone’s time...
me: You don’t waste my time, sometimes I even feel like I’m wasting time when I’m not with you. For what it’s worth, that’s the truth
budy: goodnight!
budy: yeah we should totally find something to do this weekend 
budy: i definitely have felt the happiest around you in the times i’ve been here :)
budy: https://youtu.be/sTtxT4pLGLs
budy: hey i might need some help with attaching server object for dlg
budy: do you have a sec
budy: thanks!
me: Happy to help!
me: Oh! I didn’t notice you sent a video! I’ll have to look at it later... since I have no headphones.
me: What do you want to do this weekend?
me: Also that’s sweet, thank you
budy: i was just about to advance my log to pqa1!
budy: and you beat me to it
me: You’re too late! Now you have to pqa mine too!
budy: idk if i’m feeling ambitious 
budy: check all 109
me: (You can use eaviewid with my subset ejslqf to view item 1090)
me: 👌
budy: how do you open subsets with eaviewid
me: Type “set ejslqf”
budy: good job
me: The room was double booked... 
budy: wheeere
budy: aah
me: I dunno, sounds like we might cancel it....
budy: where are you 
me: It’s canceled! We will just review the PowerPoint
budy: ok
budy: did you get vidyo
me: ￼
me: Got it working!
budy: im coming 
me: Had to return my cool red iPhone :(
me: Want to do anything this weekend?
budy: aww
budy: ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
budy: gotta log time 😑
me: That’s what I’m doing! So bad at it :,(
me: What do I log “office hours” as?
me: What do you log foundation system build as?
budy: do you want to do something today? we could grab dinner or something
budy: or something else!
budy: or if youre tired we can also do something another time this weekend
budy: up to you!
budy: also i know asking this again but is there anything in particular YOU want to do?
me: Dinner sounds lovely! Where would you like to go? Any ideas?
budy: hmm we could do something close to here
me: That sounds good. What is near you?
budy: i’ve been wanting to check out this thai laotian place but anythings good
budy: rising sons
me: Thai Laotian sounds very interesting! Let’s do it!
me: Wait quick question....
budy: we can always do something else too
me: What did Lucas Banister think of this place ;)
budy: omg i should check 
me: Jk! Sounds like fun. I’m still at work now, so what time do you want to go there? I’m kinda hungry already so I can eat whenever
budy: yeah same! i guess i’ll leave whenever you are leaving
me: Ok I am leaving now. Meet you there!
budy: ok
budy: im here 
budy: went into the library 
me: I’m here! I’ll go to the library too
budy: ￼
me: ￼
me: ￼
me: ￼
me: Hey! I just sorta immediately fell asleep after I got home and then just woke up haha... but thank you for hanging out last night, it was very enjoyable! I like being around you even if we’re just sitting on the couch watching tv. (I kinda prefer sitting on the couch just talking, but it’s still nice just being with you.) anyway, just wanted to say thanks, hopefully you got some rest last night!
budy: yeah! it was a fun time! very cozy and like you said i enjoy your company
budy: it was a great sleep!
me: I’m glad! Hmm, this rain makes me want to just have another cozy day inside :/
me: What are you up to?
budy: just found this :(
budy: https://www.facebook.com/events/329989341135426/?ti=icl
budy: we shoulda gone!!
me: Oh man! We slept too late! That would have been so interesting
me: Awww :(
budy: it’s ok
budy: lol i was looking at communication events
budy: https://www.facebook.com/events/491896224652771/?ti=icl
budy: and found this today
me: Oh cool. That’s the same artist from the workshop. Hmm... well, we can’t learn from the expert but we could teach ourselves. It says the software is called TidalCycle. Then we could go see him actually perform!
budy: ooh yeah! 
budy: although i still have to work on saving my google drive today
budy: but it seems cool
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: what are you doing today?
me: Ok, well if you’d rather you could spend the day doing that then we could just see him perform and then tomorrow teach ourselves Tidal. That’d make more sense: we’d have inspiration!
me: I have no plans. I guess I’ll try to check out a gre book
budy: ok! yeah i really should have done this earlier...
budy: sigh
me: sigh
budy: but seems cooool
me: No problem!
budy: gre wow
me: Yeah let’s go! Want to do that plan that I wrote above?
budy: i also want to go to a book store and get pd fund book(s)
me: Oh yeah that’s a thing too
budy: lol buy a gre book with pdfund
budy: not suspicious at all
budy: but yes your plan sounds nice!
budy: if you do want to go to that event!
me: Oh yeah good idea! I can hear Alex now, “so this is super random but hr called me this morning...”
me: Yeah! That sounds lovely! I think the event sounds really cool!
me: Well great! Let’s plan on that then!
budy: ok!!!
me: How much stuff do you have to get off your drive?
budy: quite a few gb
budy: don’t want all of it so have to go through the files and folders and see what i want
budy: sigh
me: That’s rough, I’m sure there’s a lot of good stuff in there! How is it coming? 
me: Ok I’m going to actually go to the library now. I’m the worst.
me: Got the book! Just in time before it closes haha the library is pretty cool!
me: How is your stuff coming? Do you want to meet at Communication, or we could get dinner before? What would you like to do? :D
budy: how about i meet you there!
budy: it seems to start at 7:30
me: Sounds good! See you then!
me: How’s your stuff going?
budy: good! 
budy: glad you got the book
budy: i need to go to that library
me: Yeah it’s a pretty cool library! I didn’t get much of a chance to explore but I’d like to go back!
me: Did you find any treasures hidden in your google drive? It’s kinda fun to look back at all the things you’ve done
budy: probably gonna get there at around 7:45!
me: Ok, that’s reasonable! Everything going alright?
me: Made it! Let me know when you’re here!
budy: here
me: Cool, I’m in the entrance area! Hasn’t started yet!
budy: ok
budy: im coming 
budy: i probably won’t be making it tonight but good luck i’m sure you can destroy them luCASSIOPEIA
me: ￼
budy: so beautiful 
budy: thanks for spending the day with me evan, i always enjoy having you around :)
me: So beautiful!
me: Made it home safely!
me: Thank you for spending the day with me too, I enjoy being around you very much :)
me: I don’t know anyone else who would be so willing to just sit and code for fun all day haha I really enjoy that about you
budy: :)
budy: i have one question for you 
budy: do you remember
budy: this
budy: ￼
me: Huh 🤔 that looks vaguely familiar, but I just can’t place what it is... looks cool though, when was that?
me: Vidya, I can’t really explain it but when I spend time with you it makes me want to blow off the whole grad school thing or moving in general. I feel content with you, like I can choose to be happy just where I am, and that’s an uncommon feeling for me nowadays. Just wanted to say thanks for that.
budy: i do feel content hanging out with you too and you definitely make me so happy! we will definitely still be friends when you move though so don’t hold back on that but overall i’m very grateful for you, i really have never had a friend like you before 
budy: you’re quite an extraordinary person
me: I’ve never had a friend like you either. You are truly extraordinary. I don’t know where we will be in the future but I do know that I would like for you to be a part of my life. You’re very special to me.
me: Also…
me: ￼BROCCOLI
me: And this is what you get when you are too impatient and grow it too fast:
me: ￼
budy: so tender
budy: that’s such a good brockollie
budy: wow
budy: those florets are spectacular 
budy: and i think the second pic is my new new lockscreen
budy: thaaaanks!
budy: ehehehe
budy: ￼
me: Wow! I’m so flattered that my artwork is being chosen over that of Andy Gilmore!
me: It is pretty cool, isn’t it? It’s so overwhelming, yet still coherent
me: I want to make a website to feature art and other projects
me: And yes, the florets were very low effort but still enough!
budy: it is! and yeah you should do that!
budy: i kinda want you to explain to me how it works when you have the time
me: ￼Here’s the same thing as the triangles except with squares instead!
me: Yes, I would be happy to explain it! What’s interesting is the tree and the triangles (and squares) are more or less the same algorithm.
me: Hey Vidya, what are you up to, I did not see you in your office! I had to move my TB test time so I’m doing that now 😬 kinda makes me nervous
budy: ￼working in barn bridge!
budy: gonna get lunch!
me: I’m in a meeting :|
budy: aww no
me: 😢
me: I’ll miss you forever
budy: 😢
budy: how’s everything going for you?
budy: i think i’m gonna try to finish my look and feel now so hopefully i do that correctly hhoray
budy: *hooooray
budy: i don’t know if you’re out already but i’m gonna check out barnes and nobles for pd fund books if you wanna join
me: Oh cool! That sounds fun! Unfortunately, I don’t think I can tonight. I have a phone call (scary!). I’d love to go to a bookstore with you another time though!
budy: ok! let’s do another time, i think i’m actually gonna take care of some other stuff
budy: well i’m sure it’ll be a great call :)
me: Ok good let’s go another time! That’d be lovely.
me: Mmm :/ I don’t like the phone it’s so hard I always feel awful after talking on it.
budy: yeah we should! 
budy: maybe sometime this week 
budy: it is what it is unfortunately...
budy: i’m making cookies and it would be so great if you were here to tray them 
me: Oh! I wish I were there with you!
me: ...Just because you’ll probably mess up the cookies without me.
me: ;)
me: But yeah! Maybe we can go tomorrow or something?
me: So when you said “take care of some other stuff” you meant cookies haha?
budy: well you can tell me if i messed up tomorrow
budy: yup exactly 
budy: cookies are the greatest priority 
budy: very critical 
me: Alright, expect to be judged harshly.
me: ￼I did something
me: ￼￼￼
me: enjoy
budy: woah the first one is amazing!
budy: the other ones are also trippy woaah
budy: must be fun to watch groq
budy: grow
me: If you give me your email address, I can send it to you so you can watch it grow.
budy: oooh
budy: girividyas@gmail.com
me: Sent! Also I put all the relevant variables at the top so it’s easy to change.
me: Not the greatest comments though, so you’ll have to guess!
budy: wooaaaaah
budy: woaaaaaaaah
budy: this makes me so happy thank you!
budy:  how’s your class going?
me: I’m glad that made you happy :)
me: The class is good! Doin some sql.
me: Fun stuff
budy: also maybe we can get lunch together 
budy: when are you gonna break 
me: Lunch is at noon. If you can wait until then that would be lovely!
me: Did you bring cookies?
budy: i forgot aww
me: OH NO!
me: I’M GOING TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS CUZ THATS WHAT YOU DO IN CLARITY
me: ARE YOU FREE AT NOON?
me: ALSO DAVIS IS IN THIS CLASS ALSO
budy: YEAH
me: Lunch time! Meet in Cass?
budy: sure
budy: im on my way 
budy: im here
budy: at red table 
me: Ok’
me: I meant !
me: ￼Monday punday! Sorry for the bad picture, I’m sitting pretty close
budy: cold turkey i think i saw these probably hehehe
budy: but thanks for sending 
budy: hope everything’s going well
me: Yeah I’d seen some of them too, but was just so excited to see Monday punday!
me: Going to learn about effectively solving customer issues?
budy: yeah 
budy: still on call though 
me: Oh so you’re getting first hand experience with effectively solving customer issues?
me: Should I do the search writing turbo room? Sounds kinda fun actually haha
me: I’ll do it if we go to the bookstore today or tomorrow
budy: yeah do it!!! then i can do my technotes easily >:D
me: Ok!
me: Done with class! Are you done!
budy: nope still in here
me: Learning lots?
budy: yeah!
me: Lucas said it actually was kinda helpful.
me: Either way, did you get enough done today? Would you like to go to the bookstore?
budy: yeah i guess we can go
budy: i just finished class
budy: have you got any secondaries?
me: Ok! Sounds good!
me: Are you coming back here!
me: I meant ?
me: Yes I did! I am the secondary for Lakeland Health
budy: i’m coming back 
budy: but may have to reconsider:/
me: Reconsider what?
me: We don’t have to do the bookstore. If you’re busy that’s totally ok
budy: sorry we couldn’t go to book store
budy: but on second thought i just ended up spending that time in your office...
budy: sowmya’s friend is here and they are working on stc and it is stressing me out
budy: like should i be working aaah
me: That’s ok! Yeah we just hung out in my office instead of at a bookstore, so the effect was the same.
me: Ooh they’re working at your house on STC? Gross!
me: I think you’ll be ok! You can work on it later or now if you really prefer.
me: I’d imagine “office hours” in your house with Sowmya would be a lot more focused than with David and them haha
budy: true the effect is the same
budy: lol it’s just nice to be around you i guess
budy: i’ll definitely be bringing the cookies tomorrow hehehe
budy: i am really liking the chocolate ones
budy: do you think you would like buffalo cookies?
budy: also i can’t believe you saw right through me about secret santa, you literally knew who i had right away!!! unbelievable 
budy: i’m usually pretty good at keeping those secrets 
me: You’re sweet :) yeah it doesn’t matter where, it’s just nice
me: Oh wow! I’m excited to try your cookies!
me: The chocolate ones sound interesting! You said they’re like cinnamon-sugar-ginger-chocolate cookies? That’s a lot of flavors!
me: Buffalo cookies sound 👎🏻 BAD
me: But maybe cinnamon-sugar-ginger-chocolate-buffalo cookies would be alright.
me: (Or maybe not.)
me: Hahaha you can’t keep secrets from me- we’re so in sync that I can read your mind. As long as you’re not thinking about buffalo sauce.
budy: don’t be too excited!
budy: gotta keep those expectations low for me
budy: yeah i would probably still try it though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: lol what if they had buffalo gelato 
budy: what a mind reader you are! however i can read your mind too so you have to keep that in mind...
me: Oh yeah, I mean you put them on the pan yourself :/
me: They would’ve been better if I were there
me: Hmm... yeah I think buffalo gelato sounds even worse. I’d gladly try your buffalo cookies over that
me: Yeah, well, you probably only told me to keep that in mind because I already had it on my mind and you just read that.
me: Also what are you up to?
budy: kinda feel like sleeping 😴 
budy: but i’m gonna read dune!
budy: also i ran your tree just now so preeetty
budy: ￼
budy: ￼
budy: 7:58-8:23
budy: I ran it while I was talking to me sister haha
budy: ^also did that
budy: What have you been up to my friend
budy: And also you are right, those cookies would have been way sweeter with you around
me: Sleeping or reading dune sound lovely!
me: I kinda feel like sleeping too honestly.
me: Wow those are so good! That second one is insane! How long did you let it run for that?!
me: What’s 7:58-8:23?
me: Is that how long you ran it for? Jeez!
me: Your sister sounds cool, maybe I’ll have the honor of meeting her one day
me: I’ve just been at home. Eating food. I might just go to bed. Maybe just watch trees growing for a few hours.
me: It’d be funny to do a “secret Santa” gingerbread cookie decorating where you get another person and you have to make them out of gingerbread
me: (Speaking of, I should find a gift! Can you read my mind and tell me what I should get for my person?)
budy: yeah that’s how long i ran them for
budy: she is cool! way cooler than me for sure
budy: growing trees how fuuuun
budy: i like the gingerbread idea!
budy: you should get them a triangle 
me: I can’t imagine how anyone could possibly be cooler than you, but she sounds pretty great
me: Yeah I’m a tree farmer
me: Either way, gingerbread cookies are fun to make!
me: Hmm... you really think I should get them a triangle? It’d have to be a pretty cheap one for 17.50
me: What about a square?
budy: squares are squarey nice
me: How’s your call going? Want to go to lunch at noon?
budy: ok :D
budy: good!
me: Cool and good
me: I’m glad your call is good!
me: Oh jeez we got a PSE :|
me: David told me this was a thing on Monday... what did he do this time?
budy: ok
me: Ok?
me: Lunch?
budy: yeah
me: Are you going to the bonfires? Let me know when you’re ready to go outside!
budy: me and davis are walking back 
budy: im back!
budy: ￼my plant has a flower!!!
me: Oh! So butiful! You’re such a good plant caretaker
me: I’m the only Epic person in this class 😬
budy: wow
budy: mount sinai is sending me things aaa
budy: and wants me to call them
budy: i’m also backing up the other one too (maricopa) 
budy: 😵
me: Oh no! That’s so scary!
me: I have faith in you! You can figure it out.
me: Just stall basically haha
me: You met with the primary yesterday, right?
budy: yeah but idk
me: How’d it go? I’m sure you did fine :)
budy: i have to call them at 3:30
budy: and they have been sending me so many things 
budy: but my call alone was fine
me: That’s good that your call alone went well! Did you help them with anything good?
me: Well, that leaves two hours to research as much as you can haha
me: I’m sure they know that you are not as familiar with their setup so they will probably go easy on you.
me: What problem are they having?
budy: i had like five things to do for them
budy: it was a data courier issue 
budy: how was your class?
budy: going to turbo room?
me: Ah yes, data courier, that thing that i feel all well qualified to speak intelligently about.
me: How’d that go?
me: Class was pretty good! Got difficult to pay attention to at the end....
me: Yup! Going to Grimm! Are you staying late at all?
budy: going home 
budy: 😴 
me: Sounds good!
me: I want to kinda, oof I’ve been sitting for 8 hours it’s hard to focus :|
budy: well hopefully it goes well
budy: how’s it so far???
me: Going well! Nothing better than coding and pizza 👌
me: What are you up to?
budy: pretty sad not seeing you today 😢
budy: nice!
budy: nothing much frl
budy: tryna read today
budy: ^the frl was a typo
me: Oh you’re right 😰 that’s so sad I didn’t see you all day!
me: That’s the first time that’s happened in like... a long time
me: Well, we can hang out tomorrow and make up for it
me: Reading is good!
me: How was your evening, Vidya?
me: Do you want to spend time together later? Like go to a bookstore?
me: I was going to ask if you wanted to get lunch but you have a meeting, huh?
budy: yeah!!!
budy: emilys sitting almost next to mustache guy
me: Oh! That’s so exciting!
me: 👨🏼
me: How is your morning going?
budy: looks good!
me: ￼It’s not the most beautiful pie but it’s trying its best.
me: I decided I’d try to walk all the way to spit and fire for lunch lol it takes so long to get here also it’s pretty confusing I had to ask someone how it worked
me: This is finna be a good pie👌
budy: hmm maybe 
budy: what did you get 
budy: not yet
me: I got a ~hamburger~
budy: we shall see
me: It’s so exotic up here
me: Did you make the MyDad hat?
me: Is this even the same company?
me: I’m 100% going to be late back to class too :|
me: That is absolutely beautiful! Are you just going to try to copy that with paint?
me: Busy today?
budy: sort of
budy: how’s it going for you
me: ￼Is this Lucas Banister?
budy: does your class finish early 
budy: he probably changed his name 
me: Class is fine. We still have a few more things to do so no idea if I’ll finish early.
me: You leaving early?
me: How is the prep stuff going? What are you up to?
me: Did Davis already leave lmao?
budy: looks like it will taste good
budy: was considering going to barn bridge as no more meetings
budy:  i don’t think i have time to finish mydad
budy: i couldn’t get it printed on color inkjet printer
me: I should suggest we finish our class in the barn bridge
me: Oh no! Oh well, that’s alright. I’m sure he will appreciate the vine book!
budy: maybe i should go somewhere exotic 
me: Well, can I help? Is there someplace I could get it printed?
budy: where do you suggest 
budy: i’m still gonna try to finish it though 
budy: im thinking observatory dome
budy: hmmm i was thinking i could print at work probably 
me: Ooh! That’s a really good idea! It’s one of the most exotic places on campus!
budy: i already bought the transfer sheets
me: I feel like that would be really pleasant!
me: Haha so go back to work on a Saturday to do it?
me: Do you need any help preparing for your party tomorrow?
me: Hmm... well if you’re setting up right now, I be happy to go print it at work!
budy: yeah i guess i have to cook food!
budy: lol really 
budy: kinda excited 
me: Yeah! For MyDad? Of course!
budy: heheh
budy: you would have to come by my house too
me: I know I’m excited! :D
me: Oh and for you
budy: to get the sheets
me: Yeah you committed to food now! You want help with that?
budy: aww
me: Yup!
me: Also do you want to do anything tonight? It’s been too long 😢
budy: well certainly if you want 
budy: i’ll be here haha
budy: hehehe
me: Ok! Yeah I’d be happy to help! Sounds like a fun secret mission. I will go by your house in like 30 minutes?
budy: ok sure!
budy: lol
me: Does that work? How long does it take to transfer it?
budy: it does seem like fun esp with the time limit 
budy: bookstore? im in barn bridge but might left my food in fomalhaut 
budy: ￼
budy: i’m doing a sweatshirt now instead of hat though
budy: and then i have to get food for tom
me: Cool. Yeah if it’s with an iron we should be ok!
budy: if any of that sounds exciting to you!
me: I will plan on seeing you soon!
me: Yeah! That does sound exciting! I’d be very happy to get food with you and even help cook!
budy: ok :)
budy: heheee
me: Know what you’re making?
me: Sorry on my way now 😬 I forgot my laptop I need that 
me: Also I definitely thought you were saying you needed to “get food for Tom” like Tom Hickey
budy: oh yah!
budy: i probably won’t cook much until tomorrow but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: you are welcome to come over but i honestly won’t have anything for you to eat really 
me: Vidya I’m here! Let me in!!
budy: but we can definitely do bookstore and woodmans
me: Ringing the thing!
budy: hows class
budy: which door
budy: also i was going to type tomorrow but accidentally hit send
me: One closest to you
budy: and yeah i definitely don’t know tom but he kinda reminds me of someone i know 
budy: oh no
me: Ok, well, if we go to Woodmans we could get some Indomie or something haha
me: What?
me: If you want, I could also just go home before dinner haha that’s distinctly possible
me: Class is good! Think we will be done soon
budy: how’s it going
budy: indomie it is
me: David broke it come to the door near the cars
budy: i think i will leave now 
budy: sowmyas coming
budy: how about i meet you at barnes and nobles

budy: but most are downtown 
me: Ok which one were you thinking?
budy: west towne area
me: Okie dokie
me: I’ll let you know when I am done!
me: Oh! I’m done actually! I will leave too!
budy: i have to do some things at home first so you might beat me there 
budy: and go to fomo
budy: so won't be leaving yet
me: Ok well I will go really slow ;)
budy: also i know this might be disappointing but i might not have the energy to hang out tonight we shall see
budy: like at home
me: No, that’s fair, I’m just like really drained from being in class all day!
budy: hmm what about we just do woodmans then
budy: you actually don’t really need to cone
budy: come
budy: i feel like i’ll have to go to the bookstore to actually buy it again
budy: how about woodmans and then we just eat indomie
budy: but keep it shortish 
me: Ok yeah that’d be ok.
me: We could also definitely just go home today and hang out a different day
me: Like, I wouldn’t be offended!
me: I’d be happy to come over tomorrow to help you set up for the party
budy: i do wanna catch uo with you 
me: I do too!
me: But it would also be ok to do that a different day if we’re just too tired haha
budy: ok let’s just meet at my apartment 
me: Like tomorrow you mean? Or tonight?
budy: then we can drive where we want to go 
budy: today
me: Ok! Sounds lovely! Are you leaving now?
budy: yeah 
me: Ok! Meet you there!

me: I’m just in the doorway that’s closer to the cars
me: I was able to get in!
budy: https://goo.gl/maps/hubSUnTMJg12
budy: Ao-shima
Japan
budy: cat island 
me: Wow is the Cat Island in Wisconsin like that? That’s so cool! Let’s visit it!
me: You’re such a nerd staring at me in the hallway! We seem to be extremely awkward at goodbyes
budy: cat
budy: idk the way my parents raised me we always go outside and wave bye until the people are out of sight
budy: but i’ve realized not everyone does that 
budy: but sorry if it made ya uncomfortable haha im sucha creep
budy: hopefully you aren’t too freaked out by me 
me: Oh! Heh... I guess I didn’t know that was a thing. I just thought you were being goofy. That’s very sweet.
me: I feel bad for not being very aware of things like that. I’m sorry
me: You don’t freak me out! I just want to understand you better!
budy: no worries 
budy: i am so exhausted 
budy: hope it was a fun friday for you
budy: i’m glad we could catch up
me: I’m tired too
me: Yeah it was good to catch up!
budy: this coming week is gonna be a busy one as i really need to make a move on stc
budy: :/
budy: but it was nice to chill
me: Yeah it’s nice to chill! I really need to study GRE stuff :/
me: Did you have a good evening?
budy: oh yeah!!!
budy: it was nice
budy: hopefully it was alright for you 
me: I did have a nice time! Like I said, it’s good to be able to do nothing with someone! We always do so many little silly things, but still have fun. I guess that means I just like you
budy: i guess it’s the same for me
me: Get some rest Vidya I will see you tomorrow :)
budy: you too
budy: sleep well?
me: Yes! But clearly not enough when you texted because I fell back asleep :|
me: Did you sleep well?
budy: yeah! i had a weird dream where i had car troubles again it was weird
budy: and you were going to help me
budy: thanks for helping with mydad
budy: we will get there eventually!!!!
budy: and also mailing the shoes
budy: and thanks for the pie although i was disappointed it wasn’t pur
budy: pue
me: Of course! I’m always happy to help, I have fun doing it!
me: I can’t wait to see the finished MyDad sweatshirt!
me: I’m sorry I didn’t make pue :/ too hard.
me: Haha also, I guess sometimes I am not clear with my language but yes, Sowmya was right, usually if I say “if you want to do X then I’ll stay” or whatever, I really mean, “I would like to do X, do you want to do that?”
me: I am not precise :| but I do really enjoy watching movies with you and would have happily done so tonight, I just didn’t want to overstay my welcome!
me: Oh sorry also I have your flash drive haha
budy: oh no worries, you did seem a little tired today for some reason so i figured you probably wanted to rest!
budy: but yeah i guess we’ve never gone hone this early on a saturday
budy: it is unheard of honestly 
budy: no worries!
budy: how’s life evan?
budy: i wanted to tell you more about my dream it was bizarre 
me: I know it’s so early! Honestly, do you want to do something? I’d be fully willing to drive back!
me: I’m not really tired, I guess I just usually seem tired in groups of people
me: Groups are scary! Because now when I want to say anything I have to first think of how each other person might react instead of just one other person! (That’s probably not how it should be, huh?)
me: But yes, not tired at all. Probably be up for a few more hours at least
me: Life is fine. Nothing new, how’s life for you, Vidya?
me: I would love to hear all about your dream
budy: sigh
budy: i guess i’ll take it easy tonight
budy: groups are scary haha i don’t know if i did good with hosting 
budy: i feel like i didn’t think of too much else to do and am worried it was boring haha
budy: but glad life is cool and good
budy: you’re very cool and good too
budy: goodnight evan
me: Taking it easy is good too. Is there anything you’d like to do tomorrow?
me: You did a great job with hosting don’t worry! I had fun at least!
me: I think everyone enjoyed hanging out and your food!
me: I worry that I’m boring too. I mean, I’m not that exciting to most people. I think you’re exciting, I feel good with you
me: I guess in an effort to be more precise, by “fine” I really mean “fine, but still have a lot on my mind and not sure what to do about the stuff in my mind.” But that’s how I usually am.
me: Are you cool and good?
budy: same, i guess i can spend so much more time with you than most people just because i feel so comfortable with you, i don’t have to be “exciting” or worry for the most part 
budy: still a lot on your mind?
budy: can’t think of anything for tomorrow
budy: anyways sweet dreams evan ✨ 
me: I feel the same! It’s nice, I don’t feel pressured to be not boring haha. Thank you for that :)
me: Well, let me know if you want to hang out. I would absolutely love to spend time with you, even if we were doing nothing
me: But yes, sweet dreams, Vidya. Maybe you will have another dream with me in it haha :)
me: I had a dream that I ran in a marathon. You, Davis, Emily, Drew Lawrence, and Alex Cook were all in it haha
me: You didn’t run actually. I don’t remember why. Emily was going slow and showed me and Davis that there is a shortcut but there was a rat in the shortcut. Davis and I still used it and made pretty good time because of it haha
me: I might be coming over in a bit, Sowmya wants help with STC haha
me: What are you up to today?
budy: haha that’s pretty funny 
budy: were we doing ok?
budy: i might be going out actually just to get out of the house when are you going to be coming?
me: Where are you going out to? I wanted to convince Sowmya to go to a coffee shop or something.
me: And like after lunch is what I thought
budy: i’m not sure yet but i don’t really want to do stc :/
budy: but it’s good to work on it, i probably should too
budy: that’s really funny dream though!
me: Haha well I’m not going to work on it, I figured we could work on something else for fun and help her when she has questions
me: Is there any reason you want to get out? I’d love to accompany you if you want!
budy: kinda might want to work a little alone today, but maybe we can do something later in the day
budy: no reason, just feel like going outside in the daylight 
budy: but that does sound nice too!
me: That sounds good! I guess we don’t get much daylight here but I’m sure you can find a nice place to go :)
me: Yeah we could maybe do something later if you wish!
me: How is life, Vidya? Are you doing ok?
me: Are you doing alright, Vidya? I want to make sure my beloved friend is happy and doing well!
budy: yeah i’m fine! are you doing ok?
me: Yup! I’m ok! Did you find a nice place to work?
budy: yup!
me: Where’d you go? Or is it a secret?
budy: im at colectivo, haha not a secret
me: Downtown?
me: That’s cool! What are you working on? I’m working more on my game, the last time I touched it was when I sent you the picture of the person! :0
budy: yeah, just random things 
budy: that’s cool! are they still bald :p
me: Random things are good!
me: Yup! I have not drawn any hair yet! Hair is hard.
me: I just made the eyes get shifted over by half a pixel to put them in the middle haha so kinda cheating
budy: i see! that’s cool :)
budy: how’s it going evan?
me: Going good! I’m not getting much done, just helping your roommate :)
me: How are you doing? Hope you’re having fun!
budy: trying to relax a bit idk
budy: i guess i should probably come back soon 
me: I hope you were able to relax a bit today! Going to a coffee shop is relaxing
me: You don’t have to do anything you don’t feel like!
budy: yeah that’s true! and the same to you
budy: i’m heading back!
me: Sowmya and I are done for the day! Do you want to get dinner together all three of us?
budy: where are you going 
me: Not decided yet. Anywhere you’d like to go?
budy: you guys can go without me
budy: i should probably work on work
me: Are you sure? Well, we could just do dinner here if you’d like! You should take a break sometime :)
budy: i might be a while longer but let me know what you decide
me: Alright! I mean, I would love to see you! Let me know what your plans are too!
me: Sowmya and I are going to Noodles and Company 👌
budy: thanks for letting me know i guess i’ll skip out on this time abd just eat at home
budy: are you gonna do anything after or go home?
me: Ok! Yeah we just got dinner and went back to your apartment. So I am here right now
budy: ok im coming backnow
budy: just got the ice off my windshield 
me: Is it icy? Oh no!
budy: see ya soon 
budy: sorry i was acting weird today, i didn’t mean to
budy: i guess i was feeling a little down today but didn’t want to make it a big thing out of it, i’m sorry i didn’t hang out and stuff, it really isn’t you or sowmyas fault!
budy: thanks for being my friend, i’m glad you’re in my life and i’m definitely gonna miss when you’re not anymore
budy: i was trying to figure out what i wanted to do moving forward as well because i’ve been so unmotivated lately but felt sort of directionless
budy: and i guess i cry when i’m feeling lost and confused so didn’t want to do that
budy: what are you up to?
me: Hey sorry I guess talking on the phone is annoying... but I just wanted to hear your voice. I just want to make you happy and feel good because you are important to me. But it’s ok to feel sad sometimes. Sometimes it’s important even.
me: I think I’ve told you before, but I like spending time with you because you as a person make me happy. Honestly... you are one of my favorite human beings of all time, I think it’s so incredible that we have so much in common.
budy: i’m just a little sad, feeling hopeless/worthless for no particular reason which happens sometimes 
me: I guess this is weird, but... thinking about life... I don’t want to leave you. I see you and I think maybe I could be happy here in Madison Wisconsin at Epic for the rest of my life as long as you are here with me. I still don’t know what my life will be like. Maybe I won’t do grad school or move away at all. It’s confusing. I do know that I really want for you to be part of my life. You are certainly a bright spot in it.
me: Yeah it sometimes happens. That’s really alright!
me: I don’t think you’re worthless
budy: i guess i’ve been questioning staying here as well
budy: like on one hand it’s a comfortable life yadayada but i really didn’t know if it’s for me
me: I truly believe that you could do anything you wanted to. It’s ok if it’s not for you! It’s not entirely my thing either!
budy: i actually don’t really feel like im struggling or will be asked to quit but at the same time i have no motivation really for this job
me: Haha same honestly like in a way I wouldn’t be sad if I were “asked to quit”
me: Is there something you think you’d be happy doing?
budy: i really don’t know
budy: i was looking at jobs today actually
me: Oh yeah? What kind of jobs?
me: Did you upload your resume? Because they will know haha
budy: but at the same time i do like “helping people” which is why i would be good at this 
budy: haha no
me: At this as in Epic TS?
budy: yeah i guess 
me: I know you’d be good at this too!
me: But if you would be more fulfilled elsewhere that’s ok!
me: What’s funny is... I’ve felt most fulfilled when I’m helping Sowmya or Lucas or David with STC stuff haha that’s more the type of helping that makes me feel happy
budy: haha
budy: well maybe you can help me too ;)
budy: i really should get it done...
me: I’d be happy to help! ;)
me: What jobs were you looking at?
budy: mainly engineering ones
budy: haven’t applied to anything yet though 
me: Were you looking anywhere specific?
me: I mean like city wise?
me: I would like an engineering or software development job haha
budy: no not really 
budy: but i was looking through rice’s site and most cheme jobs are in houston 
me: We could both go to Texas! I’d like that!
budy: have you looked at aspentech
me: We could hang out but like be able to go outside!
me: I have not. What is that?
budy: its the company that makes like process simulation software 
budy: i think you might like it
budy: https://careers-aspentech.icims.com/jobs/10170/software-developer/job
budy: https://careers-aspentech.icims.com/jobs/10125/engineer/job
budy: the bottom one would fit you pretty well
budy: we used aspen plus and hysys for senior design
me: Oh yeah actually I definitely do know aspen. I just didn’t make the connection there!
me: Yeah that would be fantastic! Make that software that chem-e’s use!
me: I think that would be interesting
me: Honestly if you went to Houston I’d literally have no reason not to just quit haha
budy: we’ll see if i apply and/or actually find a job there that i like
budy: but yeah a good thing about being here was meeting you for sure
me: I think you could do it if you wanted to!
me: I’d leave if you left honestly
me: No matter where you go
me: Haha but yes, meeting you was the best part of coming here. I think that will be the lasting impact of this part of my life
budy: ￼￼￼￼￼
budy: goodnight evan
me: Wow that looks like so much fun! We should walk across the lake! (Sounds cold though)
me: Also that’s a very cute animal. Are hedgehogs even real?
me: Goodnight Vidya :)
me: Are you at the meeting?
budy: gonna work in ganymede
me: That’s a brilliant idea. I went and my internet isn’t even working so I have no choice but to sit and watch :|
budy: aww i probably shouldn’t be skipping but oh well
me: No I very much wish I weren’t here.
budy: i’m sorry!
me: Maybe I can pretend I got a call
budy: yeah you should do that haha
me: Could you call me?
budy: lol are you sitting alone
me: Yes
budy: ok
me: I guess I could just leave
budy: yeah just leave 
me: You don’t have to call me haha I don’t know any of these people lol
me: I’m still here. Alex is presenting something!
budy:  how’s it going 
me: I went back to my office. My laptop died. Now it won’t connect to the internet so I’m restarting it but it seems stuck.
me: How’s it goin for you? Still in Ganymede?
budy: yeah im coming back soon 
me: ￼This Christmas tree made me think of your Halloween costume
budy: haha
budy: how’s it going?
me: Good, I passed Clarity! It was pretty easy. So I’m done with the 3-6 month reporting! How has your day been?
budy: how’s your evening evan?
me: My evening is good. I need to get/make christmas gifts for people, so that’s what I’m tryna do
me: How is your evening?
budy: that’s nice! it’s cool that you make gifts for people
budy: i’m doing quite well trying to read more dune and then do some training later (maybe)
budy: but i made the gnocchi i had with the basil and chicken oil i had from the chicken i made on saturday and it was quite good
budy: yumyum
budy: sadly the basil plant seemed to be wilting so i just used it all
budy: but i had a new flower today 😊
me: I feel like it’s more personal to make something, but others might not find those things as useful as something bought.
me: It depends on your gift giving philosophy I suppose!
me: Does it matter that you put time and effort into a gift to show you care? Or is it more flattering that you thought of something they might need?
me: Ooh, gnocchi sounds good! yumyum!
me: That’s sad that your basil plant wilted already :/ why do you think that happened? I moved it to the table in case it was cold.
me: Wow! You’re such a good plant-mom ;)
budy: that’s true, i guess both are important to think about
budy: i’m always conflicted between those two sides so idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: i don’t think those grocery store basil plant actually last very long unfortunately 
budy: but it was pretty yummy!
budy: ￼i want this giraffe 
me: Yeah, most of my gifts end up being completely useless. Oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: So don’t expect something with any real utility from me!
me: That’s sad :/ maybe we could find a more hearty herb at that greenhouse
me: Does sound very good tho!
me: That is one sexy giraffe. Wow where’d you find that?
me: What are you up to now Vidya?
budy: the use can be to express your care! so definitely not useless
budy: definitely should go to a greenhouse again
budy: it was made by webcomicname the one who does the oh no comics
budy: nothing much really i started off productive but really haven’t done much
budy: what are you doing?
me: My sentiments exactly!
me: I think it’s more the thought that counts. I think sometimes a store can’t quite make something as personal as I’d like a gift to be
me: Oh yeah! I knew that little face on it looked familiar!
me: What were you working on?
me: I am being very productive with not studying the GRE and instead making a gift. But I need a 9v battery now :/
budy: lol nothing just read a little more, i should make stuff as gifts too, i used to always make people cards and i’ve kinda stopped and i kind of miss it
budy: i guess similar to you i didn’t know how useful it was
budy: but seeing another person so interested in personal aspect of things makes me feel likeit might be worth it
budy: aww man wish i had a 9v battery for you :/
budy: study!!!!!
budy: ^motivation
me: Well, I think it’s worth it. I guess it depends who you give it to. I’ve never gotten a handmade gift but I feel like giving people things I make is a way I express how I feel about them
me: Some people don’t perceive gift giving as a way of expressing care for a person.
me: Just depends on who!¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: If someone gave you a gift they made would that be meaningful to you?
me: I’ll get one tomorrow!
me: ￼Lmao this is so shitty just soldering things straight to the ground and 5v pins ON the back of the micro controller👌
me: I will also study tomorrow 😬 and this weekend mostly
me: Do STC!
me: ^motivation
budy: it would definitely be meaningful to me, but definitely makes sense, we all value different things 
budy: it’s important to know what a person appreciates
budy: aaah i should 
budy: i didn’t study clinical data model so i guess i’m gonna have to take it later
budy: so my full focus will be stc
budy: i think i need something i actually care about to motivate me to finish stc
budy: maybe we can agree to work on some kind of project together once i finish stc
budy: anyways i really don’t completely understand that stuff but i’ve always wanted to learn
budy: you need to show me!!!
budy: anyways thanks for the motivation friend :)
budy: is everything going ok?
me: I really can’t bring myself to care that much, so not a big deal.
me: Glad I can motivate you, maybe I can motivate myself to go to work by remembering that I’ll see you there
budy: watchu up to
budy: are you free for lunch
budy: at 11
budy: how’s life evan?
budy: is your call ok
me: Yup! On a call. It’s good. I’m documenting it all so well thanks to auto hot key ;)
budy: i need to consult you about a autohotkey thing
me: Oh ok! I’d love to help! Where’d you go? I’ve been in calls and stuff for a while sorry
budy: are you doing anything today?
me: Nope! Are you? I have to stay a little later just to write my QAN for ITAP
me: But other than that, not doing anything!
budy: i see, nah probably not
me: Do you want to do something? I can’t think of anything too new or interesting but we could still just hang out if you’d like!
budy: hmm idk¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: we could hang out anytime honestly so if today is busy we can always find another time
me: I can finish this in like 15 minutes! Then we could hang out!
me: What are you up to Vidya?
me: I only ask because as your tutor I need you to do work
me: Completely uninterested in your life otherwise
me: ;)
budy: nothing actually 
budy: aren’t you disappointed in me?
budy: yeah i don’t have a very interesting life so it makes sense 
budy: what are you gonna do?
budy: also my analyst referred to another organization’s ts as “their allie” lol
me: Oh, well, I’m still proud of you
me: It’s hard but I know you can do it! But you can take your time and rest also :)
me: I think you are very interesting. I find myself wondering what Vidya is doing at least 15 times a day
me: But still I might have to put you in detention.
me: Hahaha everyone needs an Allie! How did that come up? Do they work with a different organization?
budy: i wonder what you are doing a lot too lol sorry for snooping in your private appointments 👀
budy: sucha calendar stalker 
budy: we did h2g testing with bryan health and it was their team and ours
budy: soo what are you doing evan i must know!!!
me: Such a stalker!
me: That’s ok, it’s flattering that you care enough to stalk my calendar! I keep yours open a lot!
me: What the heck is h2g testing?
me: I can’t tell you yet! What if it ends up being a gift for you?
me: It’s pretty cool though
me: What did you want to talk about with your plants?
budy: happy together 
budy: what you’re making me something potentially i’m flattered
budy: i guess that means i’ll have to make you something too as you’ve never received one before 
budy: what should i make though hmmm
budy: nothing super important haha
me: Oh! Happy together!
me: :0
me: Haha you don’t know that it’s something for you! What if it’s actually for... like... Lucas or someone?
me: So you don’t have to give me anything, you already give me your friendship and that is important!
me: But I would be very flattered!
me: What are you up to now? See? Still wondering about you!
budy: yeah actually i’m not really making anything and even if i was it would probably come to you at an unexpected time
budy: also totally understandable, it’s the thought and idea that counts 
budy: the time and thought you give me is more than enough for me
budy: i’m glad our friendship is good for you 
budy: nothing much still reading haha this book is long
budy: also called family it’s my sisters bday tomorrow
budy: now i’m wondering about you again 
budy: what are you doing????
me: Yeah, I don’t have enough time to make something for everyone, only one or two.
me: I’m glad you appreciate the time I give you!
me: Is our friendship good for you? That’s sort of a question people don’t really ask, but do you want anything to be different?
me: Reading is good! And that’s nice you got to talk to your family!
me: Wow! How old is she turning? 17? 18? That’s so nice! Do you have a birthday AND Christmas gift for her?
me: I am still working on a gift! It’s gonna be good!
me: Sorry I got distracted by it and forgot to text you. I forget to eat and sleep too so don’t feel too bad
budy: honestly don’t feel like you need to make me anything i kindly appreciate your friendship more than anything so i really dont expect or want anything really!!! (seriously, i like even the leaves you have given me)
budy: time is definitely an important gift dont you think?
budy: she’s 16! and yes, i got her a gift for both!
budy: good luck with your gift though, you should definitely tell me about it hehe i definitely won’t tell the giftee
budy: it happens sometimes, and i feel like you actually reply really fast always ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: make sure you eat and sleep though!!!
budy: hmmm i think our friendship is good, although i’ll say maybe ive never had a friend like you who i’ve become so close too so quickly i don’t think we are exactly the same but in a weird way i feel like you understand me more than most people would (and we have some obscure similarities too)
budy: as for anything to be different? i’m not sure i would know, i’ve never had a friend like you 
budy: would you wish anything to be different and is our friendship good for you?
me: Haha I still have the leaf you gave me :) it brings me joy
me: Time is a very important gift! It’s just about the best thing you can give to someone I think
me: Wow! That’s probably annoying to have a birthday in December. Like, Halloween is fine because they aren’t celebrated the same way!
me: I’ll try to remember to eat and sleep! I was up until like 2am last night. I just can’t stop working on something until it’s working!
me: Hmm... you are definitely right, I’ve never gotten so close to someone so quickly. I definitely think you understand me better than just about anyone, honestly. I guess it is sort of unfamiliar territory in that sense. We can navigate that though. 
me: I think everything in our friendship is very nice! I really like you, you know. It’s difficult to put into words precisely how you make me feel. But yes, you are unlike any friend I’ve ever had and I appreciate you!
me: Ugh Alex is so picky! Didn’t get checked off for ITAP :/
budy: what else do you have to do?
budy: also although i didn’t do stc last night im at 12 issues now hooray 
budy: (although im kinda still questioning some of them)
budy: also we definitely need to get gelato today it’s been a while
me: I need to look more into the communication preferences thing and have a call with him about it.
me: That’s good! You don’t really have to work outside of work
me: And yes! Now that it’s snowing, we for sure need gelato
me: You have a call, huh? Want to get lunch at 12?
me: ￼Don’t tell David
budy: that’s a perfect number 
budy: good job
budy: why am i so clueless at looknfeel evan???
budy: whyyyy
me: Ugh I have to take the bus back
me: I guess it’s fun to take the bus but it takes so long!
me: You never told me more about your car dream! I need to know more because I like knowing things about you!
budy: i need to know more about yours too!
budy: yeah i used to really enjoy reading on the bus when i took it in houston 
budy: i read so much
me: The bus is pretty fun!
me: You don’t have to pay attention or anything!
me: I should download some audio books (I don’t know how to read)
me: If you want to talk on the phone later or something I’d love to hear about it!
budy: still here?
me: No :( I’m sorry I realized I was going to be late for the bus so I had to go
budy: oh no did you make it!?
me: Yup but I’m standing and pretty packed in
me: Are you staying late?
me: Hey sorry I fell asleep. I dunno, just not in a good mood
budy: nah gonna go home
budy: but it’s already 6
me: Why am I taking the GRE? I feel like I don’t actually believe that’s a realistic path for me
budy: so i should probably get food
budy: parked in farm today so my snow would melt
me: I feel silly asking people for letters of recommendation, I don’t think there’s enough notice and I can’t bring myself to research what I need from that. Like some of them I just put in emails and they send an email to the person asking for a letter. Is that all I need? I don’t have the mental energy to even look that up.
budy: cool stuff! yeah we can do a dream discussion hehe
budy: aww i’m sorry you’re feeling down today, that’s rough
budy: let me know when you’re free!
budy: as for grad school apps yeah i think most of the recommendation things are online so you are probably doing it right?
me: Yeah I guess you already did stay late.
budy: also i think it’s definitely worth applying, as for paths i’m sure you will do something great no matter where you go
budy: ￼weird art in ganymede bathroom 
me: That’s nice! You car will be warm!
budy: is there anything i can help you with?
me: I don’t even want to go to grad school, I just want to feel like I get a fresh start at my career (and life in general). What I want is very unclear though and changing all the time.
me: Ok sounds lovely! I am still on the bus so might be a bit til I get home
me: Well that’s sweet to offer. I think the main problem is just that I don’t know what I want haha
me: Ah those are some good vegetable people!
me: Can we just start our own business? That’d be everything I could ever hope for
me: They look happy but maybe they just don’t know they are vegetables
me: But yeah, it’s ok I’m sorry
budy: yeah i completely understand that
budy: yeah i think we better start brainstorming 🧠 
me: Made it home!
budy: we will make something super great!
me: I feel kinda just sad and tired for some reason :/
budy: you don’t have to be sorry about anything! i am here to support you whenever 
budy: oh no! well definitely understand the journey is long 
budy: and it’s good to take rest
budy: do you look happy though 
budy: because even if you do you might actually be a vegetable :/
budy: are you doing ok evan? what are you up to?
budy: i was just thinking that even though i see you all the time at work i feel like i still have so much i want to talk to you about that we can’t really fit in there
budy: we have so much to catch up on but when are we gonna do it???
budy: i don’t even know what it is that i want to talk to you about haha
budy: quite strange 
budy: it’s like what you said earlier i really want to know more about you and there’s never enough time for me to find out what you have to say
me: Well thanks :) yeah we will find something to make!
me: Honestly just talking to you makes me feel so much better when I’m sad. You make me very happy! And your encouragement means a lot!
me: So thanks. You’re my favorite :)
me: And yeah, I feel the same! There’s never enough time to say the things I want to say to you!
me: I don’t even know what those things are! Maybe I just want to say every possible combination of words to you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: I guess we might not have any good time to talk before the end of the year, huh? :( I was thinking about that. This weekend is no good...
me: Damn it Zach Parkperson!
me: But yeah, I feel very comfortable being open with you. There’s a lot I want to say. And I feel confident that you’d hear it and internalize it. Honestly... you can take pride in knowing that you’re the only person I really feel like that with
budy: hahah zach parkperson!!! that’s so good haha
budy: lol also i guess i’ve not really told too much about him and it probably seems secretive but the truth is i really can’t read him most of the time maybe i don’t really know him super well myself! but i do like him and think he’s nice! im pretty inexperienced with any kind of dating thing so idk how it works yikes
budy: i’m really quite a bit anxious excited for the weekend ಠ_ಠ
budy: but yeah i don’t know how you do it, i somehow care to know more about you and want to tell you everything, it’s kind of weird how much i trust you and maybe it’s too fast
budy: (too feel so open with someone)
budy: but anyways yeah we are pretty much done for this year
budy: who would have thought i would meet the evan scarborough in 2018?
budy: you are the only person i can really say that about too
budy: also i still want to hear about your dreams ☁️ 
budy: the sleep kind
budy: or the aspirations kind
me: Haha definitely already forgot his last name
me: That’s totally fair! That means you’re both hard to read, so you have that in common ;)
me: Yeah... I mean, honestly I’m pretty inexperienced too. I get confused about it a lot. Like I guess it’s just find someone who you can get along with and spend time with them. Get to know them. I guess I can’t really think of any better way to classify it.
me: It should be a nice weekend :) just have fun. But... yeah, I’ll miss you. I often feel like I miss you. I know that’s silly
me: I trust you very much! Do you think it’s too fast? Maybe I haven’t done anything to earn your trust yet, but I still trust you
me: I guess when I came here I didn’t expect to find such a close friendship. But I guess random things like that happen! I expected to just stay here for like a year maximum then get out, but you make me question my motives for that. Because when I’m with you I feel fulfilled already
me: That’s kinda silly. But yes, I met Vidya Giri in 2018, she’s pretty cool
me: We should hang out after work sometime before we go
me: I want to know about all your dreams, sleep and otherwise
budy: honestly everything is confusing idk aaaahhh i can’t even tell if he actually likes me which is silly to say but i really don’t know!
budy: ahh well
budy: what if i’m weird or boring or don’t know what to say or do
budy: sometimes being able to be in comfortable silence with someone is significant
budy: it’s always quite easy with you and i don’t think it’s too fast but it is quite quick and all good things might come to an end eventually 
budy: never expected it either although i did think you were cool from your facebook post
budy: i think i told you this but i posted mine a week before 
budy: and then saw yours and thought, wow his post is exactly what i should have written
budy: who would have thought we would end up on the same team 
budy: and then i only made the connection when i read your name tag and i think i told you that 
budy: anyways goodnight i think that’s enough for today
budy: i hope you are feeling ok, i really care about you too
budy: (also thanks for making me feel better on sunday and most days :D)
budy: (i really have never met anyone like you)
me: Hey! It’s ok! He clearly likes you a lot if he’s coming all this way. He should feel very lucky to get to spend time with you. 
me: You are a healthy amount of weird, and I don’t think you are boring at all!
me: Ugh sorry for the long pause, I can’t seem to find the right wording on what I was trying to say. I guess if what I learned in service coaching is true, that means it shouldn’t be a text haha
me: The gist is that I care about you and think we make a good pair haha
budy: huh sounds like you should pick up the phone
me: Haha yeah maybe!
me: Yes, all things might come to an end eventually, but we could also choose to make it last
budy: thanks for saying that though although i will probably still doubt myself 
budy: true
me: A relationship is just experimenting to see if you could spend your entire life with a person. If it’s awkward for a weekend, that’s really alright.
me: For what it’s worth, I do think I could spend forever with you and not get sick of you. Sometimes I even want that. So... it means at least one person thinks you’re worthy of love heh
me: So you’ll figure it out, and I’m here for you
budy: i’m here for you too
budy: are you free for “office hours”
me: Haha not even there yet :) feel free to make a private appointment on my calendar!
budy: haha ok just let me know when you are free
me: I’ll be there soon, any time on my calendar is free to you, Vidya ;)
budy: do you want to get lunch at 12 today?
budy: i didn’t bring today
budy: hmm are you interested in chopsticks maybe?
me: Ooh! Sounds good! My call is finished so we can go whenever!
budy: im in andromeda!
budy: come meet me here
me: Ok! On my way!
me: Where in andromeda are you?
me: Have you heard the song Bambi by Hippo Campus? I’m like obsessed with it right now
me: Vidya! What were you doing in my DLG?
me: Also I got a different Epic Christmas card!
budy: i accidentally opened it sorry
budy: i was looking at it earlier 
budy: and went into = 
me: How dare you!
me: Oh well i forgive you
budy: (i wanted to see if i did all the setup right for submitting to allie 
budy: lol they just give us cash 
budy: is that our bonus?
budy: or is that different 
budy: bambi by hippocampus 
budy: will have to listen 
me: Hahaha I have no idea 🤔
me: I was wondering that
budy: im on a call with vidyo
me: This felt more like when your grandma gives you a birthday card
budy: ￼they use video 
me: Wow! Vidya on Vidyo!
me: Holly heck who are those people?
budy: that’s vidyo!
budy: submitted debug! hopefully i get at least one issue accepted
me: Those people are Vidyo? Wow. That’s your twin brother, right?
me: Yay! I think you will definitely get at least one! Hopefully 10 then you get those hints but I feel like nobody has gotten 10 the first try
budy: i hope i get 1
me: That’s all you can ask for
budy: i’m unusually tired right now
budy: how do i wake up??
me: Oh no! I’m a bit tired too; I went to sleep at like 3am last night. I’m actually not super tired but I’ll be tired later
me: Drink some coffee!
budy: so late!
budy: i wish i drank coffee maybe it’s time to start 
budy: why were you up so late :0
budy: also how do you know when they’ve graded your debug
budy: just check the excel?
budy: and is it like 3 days?
me: Yeah honestly maybe it is coffee time.
me: Apparently chocolate milk is better for waking you up 🤔
budy: hmm so distracting 
me: I told you I forget to sleep when I’m working on a project.
budy: how’s it all going now?
budy: nothing much, i was going to watch a movie called paterson which i really like but keep drifting to be half asleep 😴 
me: You will get an email when they grade it! And yeah, mine took like 2 days
budy: even typing the message 
me: Yeah the GRE is so distracting
budy: huh what are you working on???? i promise i’ll keep it a secret!
budy: i think im gonna leave
me: It’s going ok. Still just whatever
me: Hey Vidya! How are you? Just really tired? Doing ok though?
me: I would much rather watch a movie, especially one with you!
budy: yeah just doing my groceries and cleaning up
me: I’ve never seen that but it looks good and I trust your judgement!
budy: are you feeling better?
budy: also i’m still curious about your project 
me: Haha oh no so sleepy! Well, you had a busy week, that’s ok
budy: what are you doing?
me: That’s good. Gotta stay clean for Parkperson
me: I am feeling better. I guess I was just stressed. Ugh that reminds me, I have to ask people for recommendations tonight. I can’t not do that.
me: :(
budy: it’s pretty good! it’s about a simple man and his everyday life 
budy: he is a bus driver and he writes poetry about his life dog and wife
me: I will show you my project before break, how about that?
budy: i am actually going to watch it now but it is pretty nice and tender
budy: it’s a comfy sleepy 💤 
budy: gotta stay clean
budy: lol
me: That sounds very interesting. I feel like more movies should be just someone’s life, no huge event or whatever just a life
budy: you can do it!!!
budy: well that’s like in one week so when is that gonna be!????
me: So that sounds cool!
budy: (haha but eventually whenever is fine :D)
me: I will definitely watch it!
budy: also btw i like the song
me: Haha I’m glad you’re having a comfy sleepy evening :)
me: Andrew wanted to play a game so I played Catan with him. I have to get back to studying though, too many distractions!
me: You’ll see it don’t worry!
me: Ugh I was right now I’m so so tired must sleep 😴
me: Isn’t it a good song!
me: What are you up to?
budy: you should take rest!
budy: it’s nice :)
budy: i just ate dinner and am watching parks and rec while sowmya works
budy: evan why is there so much to clean i think i just suck at this
budy: what are you doing? gonna actually sleep
budy: ￼
me: Haha I just woke up from an hour long nap!
budy: this morning was really pretty also
budy: wow!
me: Cleaning and watching parks and rec sounds lovely!
me: I wish I were there to help you clean
me: I suck at cleaning some things
me: Wow! That’s so pretty!
budy: i wish you were here too
me: I could go there if you want
me: Kinda late but I’d still be happy if I got to see you
budy: that would be nice haha!
budy: but yeah i think it would be best for you to sleep 
budy: i wouldn’t be opposed though tbh
budy: but also you really should sleep!!!
budy: hmm i guess it’s up to you
me: Hmmm well it’s extremely impractical but ok! See you in a few minutes!
me: Do you need me to bring anything?
budy: lol no you don’t have to
budy: it’s pretty impractical 
me: I’m not a very practical person. I would love to! See you soon?
budy: ok
budy: haha
budy: but honestly aren’t you sleeping 
budy: sleepy
me: I’m better now after napping.
me: Plus with you busy this weekend there will be a lot of sleeping for me
me: Haha
me: Ok on my way, I’ll be there in a bit
me: Ok here! At the playground door
budy: coming 
budy: thanks for coming over evan :) you make me so happy and it’s always nice using uhhh - i mean... being around you!
budy: so impractical 
budy: didn’t get to talk about dreams again aaaaah
me: Of course! I basically just slowed you down..... but I really enjoy being used by you ;)
me: I’m a very impractical tool for cleaning though. Not usable.
me: Oh no! 😥 that’s alright. We will get much more time together
budy: i have almost zero meetings tomorrow hehehe
me: Wow! Yeah me too!
budy: just small team and mentor meeting
me: We can schedule lots of private appointments together
me: Yeah I have small team and Virtual Care team meeting
budy: haha hopefully i can be productive and make some meaningful progress!
budy: on programming 
budy: wow!
budy: anyways you are practical for other reasons! 
budy: im soooo sleeeeepy
budy: uuuh
budy: have to make bed aaah
me: Yes! I think you can make lots of progress!
me: You are definitely a practical tool for making me happy
me: Oh yeah :| that’s annoying. Washing sheets is definitely a Sunday activity
me: I don’t feel tired at all, I feel energized after being with you
budy: lol so far it’s been a never activity 
budy: same
me: Haha yeah I haven’t done it yet either :| I will do it this weekend (maybe)
me: I guess realistically I am tired but just can’t sleep yet
budy: sigh
budy: rest well
budy: i’m tired but i don’t feel like sleeping 
budy: but also i cant because no sheets!!! aaah
me: I guess you have no choice but to clean your kitchen
me: Sigh
me: I guess I’ll take a shower, that usually makes me feel tired
budy: i just wiped it a little and vacuumed a little 
budy: house is looking so clean
budy: just the bathroom and taking out the trash left
budy: i need to shower too
budy: and make the bed so i can sleeeep
budy: the bed is dry yay!
budy: showers make me the opposite though!
me: That’s good! So clean!
me: It’s all my doing I’ll accept full responsibility
budy: well as i always says people coming over is a great excuse to clean
me: It’s dry! That’s good! Now you can sleeep
budy: the last time i really cleaned was i think when anna came when i also felt obligated to wash my comforter 
budy: it’s all your fault
me: Yeah I dunno, I think it’s just that I’m cold after a shower and just get straight in bed
budy: huh that makes sense 
me: Having people over is the only reason to clean
budy: it really is
budy: you want to hide your messy true self 
me: Yeah. I don’t care if your true self is messy. My true self is pretty messy
me: It’s a lot of pressure to be around people who need things clean!
budy: yeah...
me: Yeah...?
budy: it’s a lot of pressure 
budy: my first roommate was overtly clean 
budy: but i think it’s part of hosting people to clean up so i will always do it for that
budy: and it does feel good to do it every once in a while
me: Yeah it’s true. Yeah it is nice once it’s done so it’s good to feel obligated to clean haha
me: I try to clean some when I know you’re coming over but that usually just means put everything in my closet so you don’t see haha
me: Still counts it makes me feel more organized
budy: i do the same...
budy: definitely counts
budy: and then making my bed is almost TOO neat
budy: anyways we should really both sleep
budy: goodnight evan! see you tomorrow :)
me: Yeah it’s true. I haven’t made my bed in quite a while!
me: It’s too much
me: But yes, we should sleep.
me: Goodnight Vidya :) sweet dreams
budy: :)
budy: sweet dreams evan
me: 😊
me: Did you have sweet dreams? I had a dream I backed into a parked motorcycle
me: You’re presenting at your small team meeting? Wow! What are you presenting on?
budy: oh no!
budy: it just my turn to lead the meeting 
me: Don’t you do a leader topic?
budy: yeah just have to be the one saying things and taking notes 
budy: and we also present an slg 
me: Interesting. We try to have someone talk about some topic that interests them
me: Have a good SLG to present?
me: Also did you sleep well? Have any dreams?
budy: did you change the status of your qan for the dlg to anything 
budy: i found one but i don’t really know if it’s that good
budy: yeah a little tired but no dreams 
me: For the foundation system build? No I did not.
me: What’s the slg?
me: Yeah I guess we were up kinda late I’m sorry
budy: epic has snowshoes we can borrow 
budy: let’s go snowshoeing one day 
budy: and sleds
me: Wow! That’s so fun! We should definitely go snowshoeing!
me: Where’d you learn that
budy: guru homepage 
budy: they have skates and skis to
budy: too
me: Do they have augers and poles for ice fishing? That’s the real question?
me: We should skate across the the lake
budy: yeah!!!
me: Hey you left before I got to say: have a nice weekend!
me: You will have fun, you don’t need to try to be fun or exciting or anything that just happens naturally when you’re with someone you like
me: I think you’re pretty great and I will miss you while you while you are busy!
budy: thanks evan! what are you doing today?
me: Well, so far I just took a long nap. But I’m going to go to an ugly sweater party with Andrew
me: Did you clean your bathroom?
budy: yeah!
budy: send me a pic of your ugly sweater!
me: I do not own any sweaters tho
me: :(
me: Maybe I can get one quickly
me: ￼Here’s my ugly sweater
budy: so cute!
budy: do you know that cat
me: Yeah the party was at Amaya’s apartment (you know her from trivia) and that’s her cat!
me: I’m surprised it would wear a sweater!
me: Hope everything is good with you :)
budy: oh nice! that’s a nice cat 
budy: how was it?
budy: everything’s going fine!
budy: what are you up to today?
me: He was a very nice cat!
me: It was fun, it was a very drinking oriented party we played drinking games
me: Which was fun but I guess I wasn’t super in the mood
me: Today I am studying. Maybe I will go to the library!
me: What are you up to today? What have you done so far?
me: Glad it’s good!
me: Someone at the party was from Minnesota and I asked him if he says uff da. He said it’s a real thing and so is duck duck gray duck
me: Hey Vidya, just checking in, how are you doing? I’ve missed you today. We are going to go to Lucas’s house soon!
budy: you shall have to recap me how’s it going???
budy: we did some madison sightseeing and it’s going good! thanks for checking in!
budy: what is going on at the lucas residence?
me: I’m glad it’s going good :) Did you ever go to the terrace? If so we were probably in the same place at some point!
me: Lucas’s place is actually...
me: SO NICE! His roommate is like the classiest guy I’ve ever met! He made his own vest. He’s copying a book in calligraphy and binding it!
me: But yeah it’s good. Glad you’re good. Up to anything now?
budy: what aww man i wish i could have seen them that’s cool!
budy: we went there around sunset!
me: Yeah! I wish you could see it!
budy: did you see me?
me: Wow how romantic
me: I did not see you but that’s cool
budy: also the lake was really cool did you see it?
me: I was probably there
me: I didn’t really look at the lake I guess
budy: i’ll have to tell you about it later!
me: What made it so nice?
me: Yeah absolutely :)
me: Well, glad you’re good :) I’d love to hear about everything
budy: were you studying?
me: Yup I was studying. It’s going fine
me: Just hard to be motivated to do it!
budy: nice! good job for doing it!!!
me: Wow thanks haha it’s ok
me: What are you up to now?
budy: we’ll catch up later! just at home
budy: how’s the day going evan?
budy: are you studying things?
me: Hey Vidya! So far so good, yeah my day will be mostly studying and cleaning (I’m washing my sheets!)
me: How are you? What are you up to?
me: Also when do you take Zach to the airport? I’d love to hear more, we could talk after then!
budy: getting that cleaning done!
budy: i just got back from dropping him at the airport
budy: i guess you didn’t get to meet him but i did take him too the park 
budy: and i guess we were in close vicinity at some point too
me: Oh! Haha well that’s ok!
me: I thought he was leaving later
budy: * to
me: Well what are you doing with your day?
me: Also how was the park haha
me: I’m glad he got to see where his people originate from
budy: not doing much today! maybe i’ll go sit somewhere downtown since the weather is so nice
budy: idk
me: Yeah the weather is very nice! I might go downtown too
me: You could distract me lol
me: Might have to stay in and work though. Idk
budy: yeah you probably have to study, is it coming along well?
me: Yeah I guess so. I’d like to talk with you at some point though!
me: I kind of miss you
budy: hmm well maybe if you take a study break we can just catch up for a bit today
budy: but we will have to limit our time
budy: i kind of want to see you too!
budy: (but i want you to study too)
me: Yeah that’s probably for the best. I dunno. I’ve sorta decided there are better options for me than grad school so it’s whatever
me: Glad I spent $200 on that test tho so I’m still gonna study!
me: But yeah, I really want to see you. You are important. I will for sure take a break and see you
me: When might you go downtown?
budy: maybe around 1 so i can just meet you whenever you are free
me: Ok sounds like a good plan. How has your morning been so far?
budy: do you mean you want to meet at 1 or later
budy: pretty good day so far, but yeah the weekend went by pretty quick
budy: i guess there’s the most of sunday left still
me: Oh I guess either. I might not be downtown yet at 1. I’ll let you know when I am there! Maybe go to colectivo
me: Yeah you two tried to fit a lot into basically only 1 day
me: There’s still almost if Sunday! Not over yet!
budy: ok i’ll meet you at colectivo 
budy: i might run a little late hehe so no rush :)
me: Ok! :) see ya there! Take your time!
budy: leaving now! see ya there
me: Cool I just got here!
me: See ya soon

budy: hi
budy: https://quizlet.com/2832581/barrons-333-high-frequency-words-flash-cards/
me: Hey thanks for distracting me from studying today :) although... I can’t help but to feel like actually studying was distracting me from you haha
me: What have you been up to?
budy: yeah i really like the way love and life is expressed in this movie
budy: it’s sort of like a week in his life which could be undramatic and maybe a little boring but i think it was pretty interesting and i like how plain it portrays things
budy: would definitely recommend!
budy: oh nice! so distracted
budy: we will need to play that one day too!
budy: and that other game
budy: also about the movie it has all these random little conversations he overhears while driving the bus
me: That sounds like a very interesting movie to me honestly
me: Is it on Netflix?
me: It seems very mundane but like I think that’s interesting
me: Maybe with all movies being about grand adventures and crazy things... we forget to appreciate just life itself
me: So I will definitely watch it!
me: Yes! We still have to play games! This was an exciting game! I won but very last second
me: We will have plenty of time for that in 2019 😬
me: An Uber driver told me the first ten days of the new year end up being like -10°F
budy: it’s not on netflix but yeah i like how even though it shows that although every day is sort the same and routine, every day is different and has something worth appreciating (?) even if they are simple
budy: life itself haha
budy: wow congrats on your win! one day
budy: SO COLD
me: So deep. And it has Ben Solo. Wow. Sound good. I’ll watch it
me: 🎵I’m waking up lost in boxes outside Tesco/ Look like a bum sippin codeine Coca-Cola
me: I know I’m too good.
me: Oh well, cold is nice sometimes because you can just stay inside, watch movies, and play board games. Sometimes that’s very cozy
budy: yeah i don’t know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: way too good, and yes i agree in that sense
me: I don’t know how I lost you!
me: I’m just going back to fomo
budy: ok
budy: i’ll meet you there :)
budy: it’s jerrys birthday 
budy: !!!
me: Ugh actually have a pretty bad headache now :(
me: Yeah! I wished him happy birthday!
budy: oh no! just because?
budy: nice
me: Yeah I have no idea why!
me: Yeah! What a special day!
budy: i don’t know if you still were free to hang out today, but let me know
budy: this week is probably really busy for you so we can always hang put next year too!
me: I would love to hang out today :) what would you like to do? Anything specific?
budy: hmmm idk
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: Well, we could go to dinner or make dinner. I can show you the thing I made but we’d have to either go to my apartment or I’d have to go home and get it. I always enjoy just hanging out at your place!
budy: but just wanted to let you know there really probably isn’t a great time
budy: hmmm maybe we could do another day actually i have to call my family and am really tired aaaah
budy: but i can maybe drive to your place later if you want to hang out for a short bit
budy: like after dinner
budy: does that sound viable?
budy: so like maybe ~8?
budy: i do want to see what you were working on
me: Yeah if you’d like to do that that would be lovely!
me: Another day would be totally ok also. If you’d rather wait, we could hang out on Thursday after my test but tonight is good too!
me: So yeah definitely good but we might get more time together a different day. Hard to say! Up to you!
budy: honestly we probably shouldn’t hang out this week seems like we are both pretty busy :(
budy: but there will be future times 
budy: if you we do meet up after work this week it will have to be short i’m sorry
budy: i’m gonna head home now aaaah
budy: 😢
me: Oh! You already left!
me: 😢
budy: when are you going to the airport also
me: Ok, well, yeah, I mean, I’d love to see you but I don’t want to stress you out.
me: I could go to your place later like ~8, that way I could help Sowmya also maybe.
me: If you want that, I’d go happily!
me: But for now I suppose I will go home and let you go home as well.
me: Might be kinda busy this week overall but we can make time! I’ll go to the airport with you if it comes to that haha
budy: yeah you can come over around then! i might still be busy so might have to limit hangout time (on my end) to like an hour or so for today
budy: just because i want to sleep early today
budy: but i’d love for you to come over!
budy: my flights at 7:10 from madison
me: Yeah! Ok, that would be nice! I will plan on that.
me: An early bed time would be nice, but I might have to stay up late studying most nights
me: I did not do as much as I should have this weekend.
me: But it’s also whatever
me: I will take the time I can get and I respect that you have other things to focus on right now :)
me: I leave Saturday morning actually so I can certainly take you to the airport or whatever
budy: well don’t come over if you are too busy! i don’t want you to be distracted too much for your wellbeing
budy: hmm that would be awesome if you could! for airport
budy: but i can also just park!
budy: are you doing ok though? i remember you had a headache
me: Ok! Well, I will go over for a little bit. I’ll be alright. But after that I will be focused.
budy: ok come whenever ready!
me: Yeah, I can absolutely take you! I don’t have a flight on either the day you leave or the day you get back!
me: My headache didn’t last too long and it only showed up while I was in my office haha
budy: allergic to your office 
me: Yeah, I think so! Maybe there was a gas leak.
me: Also Jerry just talks really loud
budy: lol if you happen to have a spare box i could mail the shoes in that would be good
budy: i have one but i was using it for something 
budy: but if not i can use it
budy: i’m gonna ask sowmya
me: I have a ton of boxes. Let me check!
me: I do have a shoebox!
me: Also I’m going to leave now, I have to get gas too though
me: Hey I’m here at the playground door
me: Hey everything going ok?
me: I guess I didn’t want to just intrude on your work
budy: ahh fell asleep 
budy: i hear you guys 
budy: i’ll get up
budy: eventually 
me: ahh! Sorry! you don’t have to really!
me: I’m sorry to bug you. I’ll just help Sowmya and you can sleep :)
budy: no i was gonna read while waiting 
me: I just want you to feel at your best so sleep would be good!
budy: but i think i fell asleep 
budy: are you guys working now 
me: Haha well, you are welcome to do whatever would make you feel best
budy: im just in my room 
me: She’s working, I will just answer questions as they come up
budy: i’m coming
budy: eventually 
budy: sorry 
me: Don’t worry! Sorry!
me: Continue sleeping!
budy: noooo
me: nooooooo
budy: you guys sound busy haha
me: Jeez it costs $133 to apply to Texas A&M… how much do I care about this again?
me: Ugh Why am I doing this?
budy: 🤑
budy: haha
budy: hmmm well i think you would definitely do good in grad school but yes the apps are expensive 
budy: how’s it going out there?
budy: i’m just working on some cards
me: 😓
me: I dunno. I guess I have to apply
me: I’m sure I’d be able to do it, but I’m not even sure that’s what I want
me: We can really hang out if you want!
me: I can answer Sowmya’s questions when they come up
budy: yeah i don’t want to bother you guys though 
budy: thanks for talking with me evan, somehow i just really enjoy your company, you are so easy to talk to
budy: i really don’t want to force you to hang with me all the time since i already pester you for no reason at work all the time ;)
budy: but i really do appreciate you so so much
me: Thanks for talking with me, Vidya!
me: Haha I hope you know it’s more likely that you’d have to force me to be apart from you
me: If I could I’d spend all of it with you and I still think I’d be happy and think you are fascinating and fun to be around :)
me: I appreciate you so so much as well :) you know I look up from my desk every time someone passes by not because I’m easily distracted but because I’m hoping that it is you
me: So I hope you know how much I truly enjoy being with you. You’re not forcing me to do anything, I just genuinely love being with you
me: Sweet dreams Vidya 😴
me: (still haven’t heard about your dream yet)
budy: want to get lunch at 11
budy: oh just saw davids
me: Sure but it’d have to be pretty quick.
me: God I think I’m just really bad at this job. I should just quit
budy: i’m definitely worse at this than you are
budy: 😵
budy: i still have 5 more email/ things to finish... only finished 8
me: Haha that’s definitely not true: we are good at different things; I think you’re a lot better at looking through information to find how something works
me: Hmm, well you’ll get there. I have no idea how many emails I have to send because I have had too many things to keep track of right now
me: Also, just thinking about you. How is your afternoon?
budy: do we have to do anything about this escalation 
budy: i want to go home 
me: I don’t *think* so... in the part where it points out tasks to do, it says it’s for TCs. I think that they need to set up things first.
me: Not 100% sure tho. I want to go home too so that’s what I choose to believe
me: Jerry said you don’t do anything unless your TC contacts you
budy: ok
me: ok
budy: are you done with stuff
me: Almost. I found Alex’s thing. It’s kinda funny actually you should come see it once you’re done!
budy: ok i’m on my way
budy: i’ll leave when you leave if you are almost done
budy: hehe
budy: i’m just waiting in my office 
budy: also i wanted to thank you for what you wrote previously it means a lot to me
budy: you’d probably have to force me to stop bugging you all day too
budy: somehow i really could spend all my time with you too but i also want what’s best for you haha
budy: but as far as sucking at the job i just constantly feel like it’s not really where my strengths lie and i haven’t found anything i really love doing in it
budy: and i am definitely not that good at looking through information and figuring things out, i keep feeling really bad at it all
budy: but anyways a good part of the job is seeing you so at least there’s that
budy: also i get to maybe coordinate lunch and learns so that’s probably the most exciting thing ever
budy: i really genuinely love being with you too and we still need to share dreams 
me: Aww :) well, I just want you to be happy and know that I care
me: And I won’t force you to stop bugging me so bother me all you want ;)
me: Well, I dunno. I think the people I care about are more important that any work, so maybe spending time with you is what is best for me
me: But yes, I definitely suck at this job -_- oh well
me: Sometimes I wonder why I even bothered to come to work but then I see you and I’m like oh yeah.
me: Coordinating lunch and learns sounds like objectively the most exciting thing ever!
me: I really look forward to getting emails from you!
me: But yes, I’m sad that we are going to be apart for Christmas but I look forward to you wasting all my time next year!
budy: yeah i’m just gonna have to forget about you for a bit huh
budy: don’t want to bother you over break even though i’ll probably be wondering what you are doinh
budy: that’s nice that you said that you don’t look up because you are distracted but to check if it is me
budy: i really do feel bad about distracting you all the time and i’m very sorry! but i must know what you’re doing at all times!!!!
budy: well more like just very curious 
budy: but anyways i guess we haven’t had any major disasters yet and work is getting done so we are doing at least something 
budy: and now i must ask
budy: what are you doing right now
budy: sorry for distracting you again and making your phone
budy: bzzz
budy: bzzz
budy: BZZZZZZZZ
me: Oh no! 😢 don’t forget about me! I’ll text you all the time!
me: You don’t seem to understand that you really are not bothering me! I genuinely like talking to you!
me: Any time I feel bzzz bzzz BZZZZZZZ it fills me with joy!
me: And I want to know what you are doing at all times as well! Studying is distracting me from you!
me: That’s what I’m doing by the way. Looking at the vocab words you sent :| fun fun
me: But yes, you are amazing and so sweet and it’s really nice that you care so much.
me: I always wonder if I’m bothering the people I care about, so I guess we can just come to mutually understand that we are ok bothering each other
me: Now I must ask... what are you doing right now?
budy: i guess if we mutually agree then that would be good but i will probably still feel like that mostly because i do annoy people most of the time
budy: but i like this mutual idea
budy: vocab! good stuff!
budy: i’m doing nothing quite as interesting 
budy: just bzz bzz BZZZZing other people’s phones apparently 
me: Well, I don’t think I could feel annoyed by you. I doubt that you annoy people, you’ve had a lot of people come visit you, so you clearly don’t annoy them too much
me: So, don’t worry! I’ll always want to talk to you
me: Yeah, well, I was looking at vocab for a very short time then I got distracted.
me: I had an idea. It’s not that interesting really, but…
me: ￼guess what this is
me: Who all are you talking to?
me: I don’t want to go to grad school, Vidya. I don’t feel like I want anything at all really :(
budy: :(
budy: well i still think you’ll do great at whatever 
budy: what was the keyboard shortcut for showing all windows
me: Try windows-tab
me: What are you up to? You have a call at 11?
budy: yup
budy: that worked
me: How is your morning going? Seems like Alex is going to go a little easier on me, he canceled our call and said we could just talk during our 1:1, so that’s good!
me: But in other news UPMC opened two new high priority slgs in the last hour
budy: nice!
budy: hooray high priority
budy: did you eat
budy: oh darn you have a meeting
budy: ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʕ•̫͡•ʔ•̫͡•ʔ
me: Ah! So spooky! ʕ•̫͡•ʔ
me: What are you up to Vidya?
me: I forgot to tell you about some good gossip I heard
budy: hmmm what is this????
budy: ￼
me: Ow, 😥 feeling sad Vidya?
me: Everything ok?
budy: no i just saw it and was thinking sigh
budy: the visualization of it was very interesting 
budy: i’m fine though 
me: It is nice artwork
budy: how’s it going my friend 
me: Very interesting way to depict such a thing
budy: yeah 
me: It’s going well, my friend. I dunno same as usual: don’t want to do it really
me: I was distracted so I was reading the #bonusu thread on Jodel
me: Wait it’s #bonsu
budy: i dont understand the bonus
budy: like the thread and stuff
budy: were there any particular ones that were relevant
budy: like any particularly enlightening ones
me: I looked for other TS/5m ones there weren’t any August hires as far as I know, but some TS/<1y
me: Seemed like 500-1k was about where they were at ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ don’t know how it works
budy: yeah that’s what i got from it too
me: Seems like TS can get very high bonuses at like 3-4y. Probably the top TS can get like 15k
me: But yeah just interesting.
budy: yeah huh
budy: why does it say tsa for role
me: Where does it say that?
budy: on the check above company message 
me: ... hmm....
me: Mine says tseng
me: 🤔
budy: hmmm
budy: what
me: That’s very fishy
me: We have different roles?
me: Usually “eng” stands for engineering in my mind but that doesn’t make sense
budy: yeah that’s what i was wondering 
me: Then what could a be?
budy: i cant even remember what i got anymore
budy: maybe because you’re done with training 
me: Finished the test! Was everything ok without me? How did you manage without stopping by my office every hour? ;)
me: Well, I’m not!
budy: i’m very bored
budy: but also have to do stuff bleh
budy: oh yeah
budy: what’s up with you? how was it
budy: glad you liked it!
budy: but that’s great!
me: Oh no! I wish I could entertain you with my presence
budy: hmmm
me: I probably have so much to do now :|
me: That’s very interesting... does Jodel know about this?
me: It was fine. Did like just good on the multiple choice parts: 159 on verbal and 164 or math
me: Probably did real bad on the essays. Definitely didn’t know what to say for the first one.
budy: hmm might be a good question 
me: Argument one was pretty easy though, I got a real softball prompt
budy: i remember i had the same score for both
budy: i think i’m gonna go hone
budy: not that i would ask it
budy: home
me: I’ll ask it! First post on Jodel
budy: oh lol i just did that
me: Haha too fast
budy: lol
budy: well hmm
me: We will see! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: i’m very curious 
me: Yeah you should go home.
me: How was your day?
me: Me too...
me: Maybe tsa stands for “Transportation Security Agency.”
me: And you actually work at an airport
budy: im going hoooome
budy: yeah
budy: it was okay
budy: i feel like ive hugged you a few times
budy: also
budy: and also are there really ever right reasons to do things 
budy: im glad to make you happy and got to see you today
budy: must be
budy: although i guess i didn’t see you much
me: It was just ok? Anything special happen?
me: Really makes ya think 🤔
me: Yes, a few times!
me: Well, maybe not right or wrong reasons. But if it changes the outcome then maybe. Not sure
me: We could ask the others if we wanted to
me: Yeah your little note was very cute, I really appreciate that! You’re so funny
me: Have any plans for the evening? I guess you have to pack, huh?
budy: yeah hmmm
budy: hmmmmmmm
me: I guess none of it matters if I leave to go to grad school 😒
budy: yeah i’m gonna be working on stc mostly though 
budy: well 🤔
budy: i need to actually have something 
budy: this week has been too busy and i also wasted a lot of time haha
budy: whatchu upt to
me: I have faith, you can do it! But it’s also totally whatever really
budy: true
me: STC! Sounds like fun!
me: You need to actually have something? What is something?
me: Sorry, I just don’t want to have to make decisions
me: Yeah I wasted a lot of time this week :| definitely among my least productive weeks. Oh well
me: What are you up to Vidya
me: I am going to fix the thing I was working on so I can show you tomorrow :)
me: Now that I’m done with the test I can do silly things like that and not feel too guilty!
budy: I don’t know but solid progress, I’ve been lazy and not done anything
budy: nothin’
budy: But I really want to make brownies
budy: Hmmm
budy: WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON
me: That’s fun. I wish I were there doing nothing with you
budy: Congrats on finishing the test though! Did you ask for recs?
me: Brownies would be so good!!
me: You could bring them tomorrow! I guess you’d have to or they’d go uneaten!
me: That guy says TS engineer.... but we both have the same job
me: ITS A SECRET ;)
me: Yes I asked for recs and stuff. Should be almost done now. I guess I still don’t know if I want to do grad school, but I guess I’ll just apply. But no guarantee on any of it!
me: The New York Times wrote an article on Epic, kinda interesting to read:
budy: maybe because you are tryna do more dev?
me: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/business/epic-systems-campus-verona-wisconsin.html
budy: do you think it’s worth going to the grocery store to get mix
budy: it’s not that fun don’t worry 
budy: oh i saw that
budy: i don’t like this secret!!!
me: Maybe... but I’m not doing any dev really
budy: very comprehensive honestly 
me: You’d be giving most of them away, so if that’s what you want to do, then go for it! You’d make people happy :)
me: Oh no! I think you’ll like it!
me: I like this idea that there are different classes of TS
me: Yeah the article definitely captures most of what it’s like!
budy: hmm i’ll have to do it another day
budy: the anticipation is killing me x _____ x
me: That’s fine too.
me: Like D&D or something
me: Hehehe
me: So are you going to drive to work tomorrow? If so we could drop off your car at your house after work then drive to the airport? Or what were you thinking for that? I will happily take you there! :D
budy: hmm yeah i guess we could drop my car off at home after work
me: Well, still. What would you like to be doing instead of nothin?
budy: and then drive to airport
budy: i think i will be able to park inside since sowmyas going to milwaukee 
budy: how do you log into eureka 
me: Ok! Sounds like a plan!
budy: i forgot
me: Should be nice to see your family! Do you have any special Christmasy plans?
budy: it would probably be best if we leave a little bit early like 4:30 if possible
budy: ok so i logged in
budy: Yeah! Are you excited to head back?
budy: Yeah there seems to be a few different things planned
budy: What about you?
budy: and it says ts (app)
me: Great! An excuse to leave early again! :D
me: (I’m not gonna get a very good #bonsu next year)
budy: so that’s probably the a
me: Yeah! It’ll be nice! I really like Colorado, it’s a swell place. I miss the mountains, and it’ll be good to see my family and cats
me: What do you have planned?
me: My dad used to do a “Christmas Eve scavenger hunt” but sorta stopped and I picked it up instead. I will probably set that up even though nobody really cares that much anymore. I still think it’s fun
me: Interesting... I don’t have my laptop and I definitely don’t remember my password
me: Will have to check later
me: Maybe you’re an A in ATOMS
budy: hmm
budy: yeah
budy: but wheres the eng in atoms huh
me: ATEMS
me: It’s a mystery. Who knows
me: I don’t want to study I just want to sleep. I feel so... empty
budy: i feel empty today too
budy: idk why
budy: apparently you are a systems ts
budy: i am a nonsystems ts hmmm
me: Screw the system
me: Can you guru what that means?
budy: couldn’t find anything 
budy: anyways i’ll leave you be my friend 
me: I’m sorry you feel empty too
me: I know you’re “not the huggy type of sentimental” but I feel like that’s what would help me feel better. I dunno. Sometimes it’s just nice to feel less alone
me: But yeah I should study. Sorry to just be kinda down. It’s just hard to know what to do
me: It’ll be ok
budy: yeah i mean i get it, i like sentimental huggy things in certain situations and people so i get it
budy: sending virtual huh
budy: hug
me: Virtual hug received
me: Thanks
budy: :)
me: I like virtual hugs from you
me: And real ones. Although you’ve only really hugged me one time on my birthday haha
me: Have you had a nice evening? I guess I feel a little better about the gre, but I guess I will just see ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: I’m just not sure I’m doing it for the right reasons. Like what do I actually want? I don’t know if my actions or the things I say even reflect that! Maybe that’s just how life is!
me: But one thing I do say that I really feel is true: you make me happy. So just thanks for being so sweet :)
me: You might be asleep actually. If that’s the case, sleep well :) I look forward to seeing you tomorrow: it’s the best part of my day (I say that because it’s something I feel and want to tell you)
me: Thanks for your note :) you make me smile
me: I’ll keep it in my pocket for good luck! 
budy: don’t do that 
budy: they might think your cheating 
budy: youre
me: I’ll keep it in my shoe and only I will know it’s there
me: What are you up to, Vidya?
budy: how busy are you rn
budy: could i bug you with some bug questions 
me: Hey I’m here! By the playground door
budy: ok
budy: 👨🏼
budy: !!!!!
me: Spotted? Oh man where is he going!
budy: chicago
me: Hmm well that doesn’t help
budy: did you make it home 
me: He could be flying to anywhere
me: Yes! I made it! My car is 100% smoking tho
me: You should go talk to him
budy: oh no!
budy: well i’m glad it all worked out :)
budy: i wonder if he notices me
budy: he’s talking to someone 
budy: also thanks so much for everything evan
budy: the gift but also the gift of your friendship
me: Yeah! Made it home! Just going to take an Uber tomorrow I guess
me: NOTICE ME!
budy: and driving me to the airport 
me: Do you recognize the person he’s talking to?
budy: cant really see
budy: evan this is the funniest thing ever
me: Of course :) you mean a lot to me, you know. Thank you for your gift of friendship and so much more
me: I’m glad you like it haha
me: It’s pretty silly and pointless but if anyone is going to appreciate something silly and pointless I thought it’d be you
budy: the technical problem solver part is so funny haha
budy: really it’s the most useful thing ever
me: I haven’t tried that on a real problem so I don’t know how well it works haha
budy: on the plane!
me: But probably very well!
budy: very good
me: Have a great flight Vidya!
budy: i really like the color and buttons
budy: so satisfying to press
budy: and that gradual red to orange 
me: Such high construction quality!
budy: very cool
me: Obviously a purpose in life has to be colorful
me: Honestly cardboard is a very good building material!
budy: you are so wonderful 
budy: i’m so blown away honestly 
budy: amazing 
me: I made it for you because I think you are wonderful :)
me: Thanks Vidya.
budy: thanks evan
budy: goodbye for now madison, goodbye for now evan
me: I look forward to seeing you next year
me: Have a nice trip!
budy: in chicago!
me: Cool!
me: I bet that’s insane today!
me: How much time until your next flight?
budy: 9:10
budy: i was running across the airport so fast
budy: but still boarding 
budy: ￼￼
budy: have you seen this thing 
me: Oh nice! It’s good you’re not stuck there overnight!
me: Yeah! Oh! That’s the tunnel to the C (?) concourse! It’s so cool!
me: I wanted to take a picture but didn’t cuz I had too much in my hands
me: It’s so magical
budy: yeah!
budy: i was rushing but still had to get it
budy: had to run from b to c
me: Yeah it’s too good to miss!
me: Man if you were there longer you could get the insanely spicy airport salsa
budy: yeah 
budy: what’s it called again 
me: I think it’s Frontera
budy: may have drawn a sad spider vacuuming 
me: When are you going to eat anyway?
me: Oh my gosh! Let me see!!
budy: grabbed a sandwich really fast from across the gate
budy: hehe
budy: mwahaha
me: Oh good! It’s not from frontera is it?
me: Mwahaha! Why so evil?
budy: nothing 
budy: what are up to evan scar?
me: 😈
me: Can I see your spider?
me: I’m really tired so I took a quick nap, Vidya Gir
me: Oh also I cleaned the kitchen
budy: heheh i’ll show you
budy: eventually 
budy: wow a quick nap
budy: and the kitchen!!!!
budy: that’s almost too much to be true
budy: so inspired by me and sowmyas cleaning?
budy: or maybe you were just sad you couldn’t wash my dishes
me: I look forward to seeing it eventually :D
me: Yeah I know so productive (not really!)
me: Yeah, I was just sad that I didn’t get to wash dishes earlier so I washed mine
me: On the plane now?
budy: ￼
budy: heheh it’s silly and it made me realize i don’t know what a vacuum looks like really 
budy: may have to redraw
me: That’s amazing! I love it! I really like how the carpet has a different texture on either side of the vacuum!
me: So cute :D
me: That looks more or less like a vacuum to me!
budy: yeah that was supposed to be like the whooshing air dust
budy: oops!
budy: but thanks for the promot
budy: did you make the prompts up yourself 
me: That’s what I thought! I really like it!
me: Yeah, the prompts are randomly generated from a list of subjects, adjectives, actions, and feelings. It chooses a few of those to put together
budy: rip@emily
budy: that’s cool!
me: Oh lmao rip Emily
me: That’s so sad, her grandma only likes her for Scott?
me: I couldn’t think of a good way to generate landscape prompts. Since most of your drawings are of trees or patterns or landscapes I didn’t know how to make a prompt for those
budy: you put so much thought into it!
budy: i appreciate that 
me: It’s just kinda silly. I sorta made it for myself too, like, we said we’d make our own company selling life purposes, I made it to prove to myself that I can still do anything I want with my life purpose haha
me: And so can you!
me: You could be an air balloon pilot
budy: ￼￼
budy: but this makes me such a good technical problem solver
me: Hahaha yeah that’s the key takeaway!
budy: yeah! you can do anything!
me: Lloyd can do anything too! And so can you!
budy: i like lmao it’s busted
me: Haha sometimes it’s just busted!
budy: you’re so silly 
me: 😉
me: Well I’m glad you enjoy it!
me: Silly things can be good
budy: :) certainly 
me: Your giraffe note was silly too :) I really liked that
me: Are you on the plane now?
budy: i’m glad it made you a little happier 
budy: in houston now!
budy: ￼￼i found your letter and it was very nice aaaah it has some really great words and phrases and was overall amazing 
budy: my eyes are a slight bit watery
budy: i like wasn’t expecting it at all and then my name popped up
budy: i should have known...
budy: anyways evan i think the same way about you, you really appreciate me for me and idk there aren’t too many people out that like that who truly want to be around you
budy: but yeah you’ve made the past half a year or so really great for me and although i might have been feeling kind of lost lately, i’ve also been feeling very thankful to have you around
budy: the larger purpose is out there, and i think we are on our ways to finding that intangible entity that’s somewhere
budy: anyways thanks for making me cry but like i’ve never known someone to care at this level so much, i thought only i was like this 😭
me: Haha I knew you’d find it late at night too! I have to sleep now, but... sometimes I wonder if you ARE part of that larger purpose. I’ve never known anyone like you and can’t wait to learn more about you next year, Vidya ♥️ sweet dreams
me: Sorry to make you cry! 😭 (I was hoping you would haha) glad you’re just as sentimental as I am!
me: ￼This picture made me think of you! The negative space of a branching pattern can be branching in itself 😮
me: Also I made it to Denver! Hope you’re having fun in Houston
budy: i reread it a few times this morning too, thanks evan it really makes me so happy to know how much you care, i’m excited to learn more about you too
budy: you kind of threw me off when you said that the purposes came from a website 
budy: i probably would have found it sooner if you didn’t say that
budy: is that even real
budy: whered you see that?
budy: i like jt!
budy: have fun in denver
budy: say hi to that crazy blue horse at the airport haha
budy: hope you’re having a great day!!!! :)
me: Well, I’m glad you enjoyed my letter. It’s really great to know someone like you who appreciates me for the way I am (even if I’m overly-sentimental and like silly pointless things!)
me: Hahaha yeah, well only the actual purposes are, I wrote all of the what how why things
me: I was going to add my own but those were just so random and funny in themselves
me: I saw that on the wilds of Reddit! I think r/pics maybe
me: I saw that evil demon horse! Oh such a good demon horse
me: Did you have lunch with family friends today? Seems like you had a couple of those scheduled
me: Hope you’re having a good day :D
me: ￼I’m just happy to see my cats! So cute!
budy: yeah the texts seemed too you to be written by anyone else
budy: so then i had to read each one hehehe
budy: how do you even come up with these things? i really don’t think overly sentimental is a bad thing, i definitely like that about you
budy: it’s so rare that someone is willing to be that vulnerable and admit it too
budy: and silly pointless things are beautiful 
budy: what an amazing wilds of reddit! the only thing that could make that pic better would be a demon horse!
budy: but yeah i think i might need to be a rapper so i can meet yung gravy
budy: yeah it was a lot of socializing omg but it was fun
budy: ￼i also saw this cute pokémon card today
budy: your cat is very spectacular, what is your cats name? 
budy: what have you been up to evan?
me: Wow you read all of them! :)
me: I’m glad you can recognize my writing style haha we’ve sent enough texts I guess
me: Haha I guess I just don’t ever think anything is impossible so I just make anything
me: But haha I’m glad you appreciate my sentimentality :)
me: I trust you a lot :)
me: Absolutely I actually wrote that one knowing in my heart that that was your calling
me: Meeting yung gravy
me: That’s a cute pikachu! I have one of those too!
me: What a good boy!
me: My cat is named Daisy! Also have a bigger one named Lucy
me: Well, I made cookies with my grandma and went to dinner now watching Elf! Elf is the best Christmas movie I think.
me: Lots of socializing sounds so scary! Haha it was fun though? You just got together just to see friends? Have you known them long?
budy: i trust you a lot so i know that is definitely my calling 
budy: although there were quite a few attractive options
budy: except for dentist hehe, not THAT much of a sadist
budy: daisy and lucy how cute
budy: that sounds like a lovely day :) i will have to try to watch elf with my sister 
budy: it is a pretty good one!
budy: as for socializing it’s all people i’ve known for forever and hanging and eating with them
budy: i guess it’s hard to describe but ya!
me: Absolutely! You could also be a pretty good hot air balloon pilot
me: You might be able to meet yung gravy doing that too.
me: Yeah I wouldn’t describe you as sadistic. But maybe I just have t seen that side of you yet.
me: Yeah it was a pretty nice christmassy day! Today I am going to Golden and will hike South Table! I’ll send you a picture
me: That sounds pretty fun. It’s cool to have those family friends. Anyone roughly your age?
me: So social
me: What are you up to today?
budy: hmm maybe we can do a hot air balloon business 
budy: then we will definitely meet yung gravy
budy: i haven’t seen a sadistic side of you either honestly, but maybe that’s another day thing
budy: is that the place that you said you usually drive up that was in your dream? hope it was good!
budy: awww you’re going into the mountains like you said you would! wow so ~colorado~
budy: yeah there’s a very wide  range of ages which is cool
budy: today me and my sister watched a bad movie (the princess switch), baked some cookies (white chocolate macadamia), and learned/played a board game (pandemic)
me: Yeah! I think we should! You only need... was it 12 hours of training? Then we can also get a balloon!
me: Maybe young AG can fly on our balloon too.
me: ￼Yeah! I saw the ~mountains~ wow! South table is on the other side of Golden from where my dream was. There are two lookouts! If you zoom in on the mountain you’ll see it has an M on it, that’s where we were in my dream!
me: ￼Then here’s the howdy folks sign
me: ￼And then I went to a dessert bar in Denver that has really good churros!
me: That sounds like a very fun day! It’s nice you got to spend time with your sister!
me: What is your favorite Christmas movie? I like Elf and the Grinch (like the old animate one)
me: Just copying me, huh? Well, I’m flattered really ;)
budy: it’s so rocky! and mountainy wow, howdy folks! i very much appreciate the pics and those look like some nice churros
budy: hmm i’m not sure! i really do like elf but im not sure what i would say my favorite is
budy: i haven’t seen the animated grinch before though but i saw they made a new new one 
budy: and yes you should be flattered:)
budy: i’m thinking about my plants i hope they haven’t died 😰
me: Haha you woke up at 6am and immediately started thinking about your plants? You’re so dedicated!
me: You are a good plant mom. But don’t worry, I think they’ll be fine!
me: I also forgot to water Chlorophilip before leaving!
me: Yes! Rocky and mountainy! Whoever named them was so so clever
me: Yeah they were some real good churros! I wish there were a good dessert bar in Madison
me: Hmm... well, you’ll have to think of your favorite Christmas movie.... this is potentially a dumb question, but are there any good Hindu holiday movies?
me: Yeah what’s up with the new new grinch? The original is the best!
me: What are you up to? Where did you see that car? Haha
budy: i wasn’t tired last night lol and i was wondering about many things including my plants 
budy: hopefully they’re alive, my mom wants me to investigate why her low maintenance plant isn’t growing and tell her what to do
budy: so i need to do that 
budy: oh no chlorophyllip!!!
budy: you could tell jerry to water lil phyll
budy: no not really, i’m not the biggest knower of any hindu films hmmm
budy: definitely grew up watching more christmas ones
budy: i saw the car in a parking lot today, not terribly exciting but yeah
budy: didn’t do too much today but just finished up getting gifts and wrapping stuff for my family (and the parents of the house we are going to tomorrow since they are also like our family too)
budy: and watched some movies with my sister (they were not that good: the christmas prince and crazy rich asians)
budy: although i do see how the latter one was interesting maybe still not my thing 
budy: and i have to finish making some things for tomorrow
budy: what have you been up to evan?
me: Merry Christmas, Vidya! I sorta wish you were here! I’m sure you will have an excellent day in Houston :)
me: I guess thinking about plants is as good a thing as any to think about when you can’t sleep!
me: I know! 😬 yeah I should just tell Jerry to water him. Although honestly I’ll just water it on Friday, it’ll be ok!
me: I’m sure your plants are good too
me: Lil phyll ;) I like that
me: You still need names for your plants, I think it’s important
me: Getting gifts for people is fun! Some people are hard to get gifts for though.
me: Are these just more family friends that you are going to spend today with? But basically family? That’s good! I’m not sure I really have anyone who is like honorary family
me: Yeah, a lot of people really loved crazy rich Asians, like I thought it was fine but like not that good overall ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: What were you making?
me: Yesterday I just spent the day with my family, it was nice, my grandparents came over and we went to church and stuff. They came over today too and we opened presents and stuff together! Almost all of my gifts are warm clothes for the cold Wisconsin winters haha
me: I got an electric blanket which I’m super excited about!
me: How is your Christmas going? Hope you are doing well!
me: Playing Pokémon Go, huh Viidya? :) thanks for the gift, I will treasure it always and forever. Our friendship level increased! How are you? I was just been thinking about you
budy: wow you are gonna be so warm! i got a nice non electric blanket
budy: i’m glad you liked my gift
budy: i’m a little drained by all the visiting and seeing people and doing family things honestly 
budy: i think i’ve gotten used to quietness
budy: but it’s also good to be with family 
budy: but yes i hope you are having a lovely christmas!
budy: thanks for just been thinking about me :) i’ve been hoping you’ve been good too!
me: It’s the best gift I’ve ever received! You just felt like playing Pokémon go today?
me: Yeah, I totally get that. I mean, I always feel so drained after doing family stuff
me: Well, I’ve told you before, I just feel drained being around people for too long, but I don’t feel that way with you
me: Yeah! I got used to being alone. Do you like that quietness?
me: It’s been a nice day though! What have you been doing?
budy: i’m glad! yeah i was just playing with my friend a little while we walked the dog
budy: yeah i think i just get drained being around people for the most part, but yeah it depends on who
budy: i do like the quietness and being able to sort of have control over my own day/set my own pace if that makes sense
budy: it’s kind of stressful lol i don’t know, so many expectations floating around and i’ve kind of enjoyed being away from it
budy: but yes i like quiteness and being alone, but i don’t think i’m antisocial or anything if that makes any sense 
budy: and i do like being around people and family but i do find it tiring 
budy: but yeah it’s still been a nice day and i’m thankful to be here
budy: but yeag can’t help but feel inadequate when being around my family but it just be like that sometimes :/ gotta accept that 
budy: also random tangent but are electric blankets nice?
me: That’s fun. Your friend plays it? This is a friend you’ve known for a long time?
me: Do you feel drained around me? You can always let me know, like I understand that!
me: That does make sense. I feel kind of limited in what I can do because I have another schedule to fit into!
me: I don’t think you are antisocial, that’s how I am too. It’s natural!
me: You feel stressed, you mean by your family’s expectations of you?
me: I know it’s impossible for me to know what your family is like, but I don’t think you should feel inadequate! I think you are doing well! Of course we are still figuring things out, and that’s ok.
me: Well, for what it’s worth, I’m proud of you, and regardless of anything else, I think you are a very good person; someone worth being and being around
me: And yes! Electric blankets are lovely! You’re welcome to try it! It’s like a blanket but better!
budy: yeah she plays and yeah  she’s like my cousin (her dad is my dads friend from college)
budy: no i always end up feeling better after seeing you honestly 
budy: yeah it’s hard to explain completely but thanks for the support i appreciate it
budy: and it means a lot to know and have a friend like you so thanks 
budy: i will have to try that electric blanket sometime 
budy: hehehe
budy: hey evan i hope you know that l think you are one of the most remarkable people i have met and you have made a difference to me as well
budy: making life better for those around you maybe is the best goal to aspire to be
me: That sounds like fun! Anyone who plays Pokémon Go is a friend of mine! (But not a best friend, I’m not level 10 yet)
me: I’m glad that you feel better with me, I absolutely feel the same! I keep feeling tired at family things then feeling like I miss you
budy: :)
me: Well, yeah, if you want to talk about how you feel with your family, I’m of course willing to listen, but yes, that’s my two cents on the issue!
me: We can watch a movie or something with my blanket :)
me: And yeah, I don’t know what a person’s purpose is, but that’s what I think. You are one of my favorite people in the whole world and you are special and important to me.
me: That’s the best I can tell you with 100% certainty about your “purpose” in life
me: Are you doing ok?
budy: yes i am doing ok, but yeah just been feeling like i will never be able to make them happy or be satisfy what they want me to be
budy: idk i probably just need to stick up for what i want instead of always going along with things 
me: Yeah, I mean, I think that’s right! Is it something specific they want you to be? You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to
me: If you are happy, they should be happy for you. If you’re not, they should encourage you to find what it is that you do want for yourself. I get that it’s more complicated than that, but in the end, they should want for you to be happy
budy: idk it’s hard to explain, but sometimes indian parents are just different in the expectations they have for their kids, they aren’t forcing me to do anything but anyways there’s a lot of pressure 
budy: just to always have a “good” job and be “successful”
budy: but yes i know they just want the best for me and i do love them
me: Gotcha. Well, yeah I guess I figured that was what you meant. So they make you feel like you are not successful? And that you don’t have a good job? What would be a good job? I guess we are all basically doing this job as “something to do” so I guess it’s better than no job at all.
budy: i think i just need to be better about being sure of myself rather than constantly thinking of their approval, there’s many different definitions of success really
me: Yeah, I mean, I’m sure that is a big part of it.
me: So they don’t tell you it’s not good, you just feel that yourself?
me: I struggle with that too though. It’s hard to figure out and feel successful. I’m not sure many people do at our stage of life, even if you do have an amazing perfect job, there’d be other ways you feel lacking
me: And so you just have to decide to feel confident in yourself
budy: yup i guess that’s the way to go
me: Honestly I have a hard time with that... like, people who are very important to me have told me many times that they don’t respect what I do. Or that they just generally don’t like the way I am. It’s hard to hear from someone you care about. I don’t know if I’m handling it well.
me: Actually I know I am not handling it well.
me: That’s one of the big ways I like you: you like me as I am. But I hope it’s not a mistake to use that as a reason not to change, like maybe I really am bad....
budy: yeah, i think the hardest part is when you so deeply want to make the people you care about happy, but it seems like you can never fulfill that
budy: what do people want you to change though and what would they not respect about you?
me: I dunno, I guess it’s complicated. I just wanted to tell you I know what that might feel like. It’s a bit different tho
budy: i appreciate it, things are complicated for sure but ya if you ever want to talk about it i definitely understand
me: But like, I wonder sometimes, like, you make me happy and I think I make you happy too. Why is that different? Are we both seeking affirmation?
me: And thanks. I appreciate it. I think I either have to decide not to listen, or decide to change myself. You make it easier for me to want the former
budy: i don’t think you’re bad at all and i’m sure the people who are important to you don’t really want you to change yourself 
me: I mean, I would hope so, but I am not sure about that.
me: Either way, yeah, I appreciate you for that and I think that you are worth being proud of
budy: hmm yeah things are complicated and i get that
me: I personally like you a lot for reasons that have nothing to do with what job you have or anything like that.
budy: but yeah i honestly don’t get what you would need to change
budy: (i’m not saying this to affirm you but i honestly think you are fine)
me: Well, I think the same. You are doing great. I say that putting aside anything I might feel about you personally. You don’t need to change
me: You have what is by all means a great job and a great degree and you are very smart and creative. You could do anything
budy: i mean i would say the same about you
budy: i would add that you are also talented, willing to help people, thoughtful, and openminded
budy: i do have my flaws which i definitely have ti work on though! there are always improvements to be made and ways to grow
budy: so i understand that
budy: but i think that is different from changing your fundamental self
me: Well, thanks :) and yes, everyone has ways in which they could improve. I certainly have many things I could change and grow
me: But you are right. I don’t want to change my fundamental self and maybe if someone expects that from me it is not fair
me: (It’s so complicated tho)
me: Either way, yeah, I guess don’t feel too worried about your family’s expectations. You are still growing and becoming the best version of yourself
me: In the meantime, it’s good to appreciate what you do have!
me: And just make the most of it. I think you are doing well at that
budy: hmm well we might have to discuss at a later time, if you would want, but anyways expectations are rough but i think you’re cool and are doing great
me: Sounds good, it’s pretty late there! You are cool and good
me: ;)
budy: yeah just want to be enough for them but maybe that’s not possible 
budy: so i should at least be enough for myself 
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: I am sure that you will make them proud. And yes, for what it is worth, you are enough for me.
budy: you are more than enough
budy: anyways i do want you to know that i am feeling fine and thanks for the support 😴 
budy: i’ll have to explain it more in person at another point
me: :) you make me so happy
budy: sorry for the longish conversation here yikes
me: Of course! I am always happy to talk!
me: Don’t worry! I really missed talking to you, so even if it was about hard topics, I still was really happy to have a long conversation
me: So yeah, I hope you are having a good time regardless!
me: You are great, Vidya ❤️
budy: you are great too evan (^ᴗ^)ノ
budy: goodnight 💤 
budy: hi evan, how was your day?
budy: i am sort of sorry for ranting about stuff for such a long time last night, but yeah thanks for listening :)
budy: today i:
-went to this driving range game called topgolf that they have here (have you heard of it?)
-started a puzzle while watching a movie
-went to the temple
budy: what did you get up to? and are you doing good?
me: Hey Vidya! My day was good, sorry I didn’t reply, I was hanging out with my friend Emma, the one who works at OHSU so that was nice!
me: Hey, really, I am always happy to listen to you. It is really important to me that you are happy and feel good, so I really like that you feel comfortable talking to me. I want you to be happy
me: I’d love to talk more when we are both back.
me: That sounds like a fun day! Yes, we have top golf in Denver too, but I’ve never gone. I’ve heard it’s really fun
me: Puzzles are fun too! Were you watching more dumb movies with your sister?
me: I spent a lot of the day watching my mom try to play Zelda breath of the wild haha then I saw my friend and we got tea!
me: I am going back to Madison today :0 oh well, I’m ready to get back I suppose.
me: What are you up to today?
me: And yes! I am doing alright. Something I’d love to talk about but I’ll tell you when we’re back. Are you doing good? Feeling a bit better now? I’m always here to talk of course :)
me: On the plane back to Madison! I’m sad you won’t be there yet 😭 hope you’re having a nice day!
budy: oh that’s cool! did you tell her how demanding ohsu is!??? haha
budy: i also reconnected with my friend elaine today
budy: Winter Freezes at Lake Mendota [OC]
budy: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/aa398b/winter_freezes_at_lake_mendota_oc/?st=JQ7J2KXI&sh=5e7df418
budy: mendota!
budy: and the plants 
me: Well, I don’t know. If there were no other factors, then no, I wouldn’t even consider going to grad school.
budy: you can borrow my purpose in life machine, it’s very useful and sounds like could come in handy for you!
budy: hmmmm
budy: just reached chicago!
budy: my flights boards at 5:10 :o
budy: i actually have a while
me: Jeez that is a while! If I had a car I could go visit you in the airport
me: You should go to the spicy sandwich place in O’Hare
me: Are you just going to wait in the airport?
budy: yeah i know i’ve asked this a bunch but what was it called
budy: sorry! you honestly don’t have to reply so fast haha!
budy: i considered maybe going out and exploring but i only have my light jacket
budy: is your car actually broken? :o 
budy: and i’ve been making solid progress on stc so might be time efficient to crank it out here
budy: and was your trip back good?
me: It’s called Frontera
budy: maybe i’ll respond to your questions later to give you a break haha!
me: Hmm, yeah might be a bit cold, and I don’t know if there’s anything near the airport worth exploring so you’d have to take an Uber or something
me: Yeah, well that certainly makes the most sense time wise! But you could do anything you want!
budy: i could take a train but i’m also carrying a lot
budy: nah it’s super cold
budy: im just gonna stay inside
budy: so the last time you tried it was dropping me?
budy: and then id have to do security again
budy: it’s so cold in madison today!!!
me: Yeah probably not worth it at all!
budy: hmmm
budy: was it bad on the way back 
me: Yeah it’s so cold! High of 20!
budy: well i’m glad you like my texts but i guess i’ll try to be more efficient:
- that’s funny she agreed about ohsu
- i did top golf with my family and family friends (their kids)
-it actually is called butterfly center but i blanked on the word and i’m not scared but just jumpy
-i like those trees
-pikachu is meant to be shared
-it’s probably for the best that you’ve forgotten me and i guess you can spend new years with david and emily! you’ll have to tell me how it goes
-no, never really pictured it so i guess i’m not a sappy romantic like you
-that is pretty cool and neat thanks for showing me
-honestly don’t worry about replying you are really fast and most of the time i just reply really fast because you do too!!!
me: It’s sunny though, so it looks nice!
me: It’s deceptive
budy: we will have to visit chicago another time i guess 
me: Yeah we could visit Chicago like next next weekend or something if you’d like!
budy: that might be fun 
budy: i guess judy was right 
me: Yeah! We should go on one of the upcoming weekends :)
me: What was Judy right about?
me: I mean, everything, obviously, but what specifically are you referring to?
budy: lol i remember she said something about it being sunny in the winter
budy: what are you doing?
budy: what’s the best place to sit in this airport
me: Oh haha yeah that’s true! And the sun isn’t hot here :(
me: I got bored so I’m making cookies!
budy: ooh what type
me: I do not know :| the best place to sleep is in some walkway I don’t remember where tho. It was the warmest place.
budy: oh no!
budy:  🦋 
me: Chocolate chip!
budy: have fun with mychart how’s the day going
budy: anything different? lil phyll still alive? 
me: Not that exciting, my parents gave me chocolate chip cookie mix for Christmas haha
budy: ooh cool!
budy: that’s fun!
budy: did you finish your ~apps~
me: ... no i dunno
me: Maybe I shouldn’t do them
me: I don’t want to go to grad school, it would be a waste of everyone’s time, money, and energy
me: I mean I guess I just don’t know it was a stupid idea overall and I think a lot of my thinking on that has changed
budy: so broken!
budy: are you gonna get a new one 
me: I don’t know I just want to like do nothing forever
budy: sounds like a cool simple day!
budy: and im glad phyll is ok
budy: nothing forever?
budy: it was good!
budy: do you think that you just don’t feel like grad school is the right move?
budy: it was made by someone who knows a lot of things!
me: Haha well, I’m glad you think so
me: Somehow it seems a lot more complicated than just knowing what to do with my life
me: Because it’s almost like grad school isn’t my choice
me: I dunno, it’s a lot more complicated than just do I want to go or not.
budy: yeah things can be complicated, do you know what your choice would be? and if it’s not your choice then what would it be?
budy: i’m not frustrated but maybe the bulleted list makes it seem that way
budy: but yes there was a very cute turtle struggling to eat a leaf
budy: haha!
budy: i took my sister downtown today so it was nice!
budy: i’ll have to tell you about it when we get back but also someone got engaged in there
me: Oh no! Your flight was delayed? It’s now at 7? :(
budy: hope the day is still going swell
me: O’Hare is the worst
budy: what does that ahk do?
budy: yeaaaah
budy: error logs?
budy: quick question: what’s the diff between QUIT and q
budy: they are the same right 
me: That’s gross
me: Yup, they are the same
me: One is just bigger and easier to see
budy: GROSS
budy: how are the cookies 
budy: turtles are fascinating to watch as they eat
budy: wow mychart party
budy: kinda wish i was back too...
budy: that’ll be fun though! you’ll have to tell me how it is
budy: i am going to be at another persons house yaaaaay
budy:  i see! that sounds really fun!
budy: and useful 
budy: you will have to show me :)
budy: i really just want to talk to you!!!
budy: what are you doing this weekend?
me: ... actually I lied, I was considering making cookies but just didn’t :/
me: I dunno, I’m just stressed. Really did nothing today which doesn’t help.
me: I’m sorry
me: How is the airport?
budy: omg!!! 👨🏼
budy: hmm maybe we can talk today when you get home
budy: maaaaybe
budy: it’s alright, i think it’s gonna take off at 6:45
budy: write that statement!!!
budy: so that’s good!
budy: i’m sure you will find stuff to do also
budy: you seem pretty stressed today! are you alright? is there anything i can help you with
budy: something it’s ok to just rest when you are stressed!
budy: i would make you cookies if that would make you feel better!
me: That’s good! Still sucks it was delayed, but you’ll be home soon!
me: Sorry I can’t pick you up from the airport :(
me: Well, I mean, I guess I could check my car
me: Or I could get Andrew to go to the airport with me!
me: That’s a very kind offer of cookies, I’m really ok, just not enough energy to do anything
budy: i would love to talk to you!
budy: if you are free! but if you want to enjoy solitude you know i totally get that
me: It’s just the applications...
budy: But anyways that must feel nice to return the library book!
budy: And also yes I have literally nothing better to do than talk to you, so that’s why I message you
budy: In case you didn’t know
budy: no worries! i’m good, thanks again for driving me there last week though!
budy: Very good personal statement, very accurate and personal and succinct
budy: it’s now 7:30
budy: What are these 4 projects????
budy: I am not up to much, just ate dinner at home with family and am later going to watch something with my sister while we try to finish up the puzzle
budy: you should check your car eventually though!
budy: yeah those are tough but i believe in you :)
budy: are you free right now? would love to talk to you if you have the time! im so bored!
budy: ￼
budy: yay im on the plane!
budy: good talking to you!
me: Wow! Well, I won’t be convinced until you actually land in Madison
me: You never know with those things!
me: But yes! Hope you have a good flight! It was nice talking to you too’
me: !
budy: !
budy: i guess we can catch up when i get back too! so that’s fine too!
me: ❗️
budy: i know you don’t like phone calls also so it can probably wait
budy: ‼️
budy: but i hope the projects are going well and i will look forward to the enumerating
budy: whenever that is
me: I should just use that emoji instead of exclamation points. It was nice talking to you❗️
budy: i am free too though!
me: I look forward to seeing you tomorrow‼️
budy: i can’t believe you saw 👨🏼again!!! i really like that picture you took, hope it’s ok that i saved it
budy: also is it snowing a lot? is it pretty?
budy: me too‼️
budy: hopefully you are not sick and not coming down with something 
budy: i have quite a many questions and things to tell you
me: Haha if I am I will fight it off just to see you
budy: haha i promise i am not that worth it but i’ll see you then
budy: maybe i should pull a sowmya and just got to the movie theater from the airport 
me: Yeah just take an Uber from the airport to a movie theater
budy: i could see aquaman because it was good apparently 
budy: or see spiderman again
me: Yeah! I’ll go too and you can see Aquaman and I’ll see Spider-Man
budy: in sync 
budy: ￼
me: Perfect! We can be in the same place while not interacting or even seeing each other!
me: Or I’d see Aquaman again if you were going
budy: ￼￼
budy: yeah‼️‼️‼️‼️
budy: ￼
me: Yeah‼️‼️‼️‼️ sounds like a plan see you there ;)
budy: ￼
budy: i do like interacting so that’s a shame
budy: sorry cut you off mid bye
me: Yes. Interacting is my favorite.
budy: anyways goodnight 
me: You could come here and we can watch incredibles 2
budy: i thought you watched it
me: Or go home after your long journey
budy: ⛄️
me: Yeah but that way it’s a movie we’ve all already seen
budy: haha yeah
budy: ok goodbye 
me: Have a good flight!
budy: i would have probably wanted to visit you if the flight was on time but it’s gonna be late
budy: and i started this journey quite early in the morning 
budy: hey evan! how was your day?
budy: 😴 
me: Hey Vidya! I’m good, Andrew got back and we watched incredibles 2
me: Yeah, if you were on time that would have been nice!
me: How has your day been? What did you do?
budy: they are still deicing plane
budy: oh nice! you guys finally watched it!
me: But yeah, you’ve been traveling for a long time❗️
budy: met up with my friends (tyler and colton) today
budy: it’s been good!
budy: yeah 
me: Yeah! We finally did it!
me: Oh classic just delaying a bit longer
me: That’s cool! How are the living meme and the guy who produces young ag’s music?
budy: yup!
me: Glad you had a good day! What did you do?
me: Well, I’ll definitely see you tomorrow still and we can hang out this weekend or even after work sometime
budy: we just got lunch and talked for a while!
me: So that’s ok. For now, good to get home!
budy: it was nice to catch up with them
budy: yeah i think you need to meet colton
budy: yeah :)
budy: i told them about you and how you almost lived with kenton and they thought it was funny
budy: they know him
budy: ok goodbye 
budy: i’m working on stc finally and i am struggling a little aaah can i ask you a question 
budy: i’m unsure of how to call a tag in another routine
me: ✈️
budy: actually i think i’m doing that part right
budy: i might have said this a lot already but i really am very thankful to know you! 
budy: i’m just really not able to get their zzser thing to work
budy: just so you know!
me: That’s fun! Good to catch up and talk really!
me: I think that’s something that deserves to be said :) I’ve said it before too, but I really care about you and am glad I met you as well :)
me: I definitely need to meet him, but I’d probably be a disappointment since he’s met Obama :/
me: You’re sneaky! Looks like you left! Well, thanks Vidya. Also, I do feel better after talking to you. You have a way of doing that: you just generally make my life better. I look forward to seeing you :)
me: Wow! I’m flattered you told them about me! ;) and haha we still need to actually talk to Kenton
me: Oh wait! You didn’t leave!
me: Good! STC is fun stuff!
budy: im still here... classic
me: Ok, so you got that (it’s with ^ right?) but now what are you working on? I don’t remember what zzser is. Like the provider search? But a library function?
me: Heh heh heh
budy: it’s just the part which loads the provider info, right now i’m just tryna get it to print out the city and zip but i can’t even get that
budy: you have made my life better too!
budy: it seems like the tag they provided isn’t working though, maybe someone edited it?
budy: it seems like it uses a function to determine the line with the primary address but this line is returning null
budy: lol quick stc question because i was wondering about this earlier, what does h tag do
me: I am not sure... they changed it since when I did the exercise so I never used zzser :( can you send me a picture of that function? Specifically its header where it says the parameters and stuff?
budy: i just saw it in some random routine and didn’t remember 
budy: ￼
me: Haha you’re funny
me: Oh ok. So you’re calling that function getProviderInfo, and you’re using the city, zip, and phone parameters as outputs? Are you remembering to put the dots on the parameters you want as outputs?
me: I have no idea!
me: getProviderInfo^ZZSER(ID,.city,.zip,.phone)
budy: ok it wasn’t in the manual
me: Like that?
budy: but anyways you do make my life better!
budy: yeah i tried that!
me: It’s like a function where like s or q or i would be?
budy: i tried pasting in getproviderinfo into my code
budy: yeah
budy: and it seems like the ln=$$serAdrLn(id) line is returning null
me: I have no idea I have never seen that!
budy: so it’s not finding a primary address?
me: Hmm. Have you tried with the internal and external id?
me: I can try it tomorrow
budy: hmm maybe that’s the problem!
budy: and i’m glad i make you feel better by talking! i really do feel better too
me: Yeah that can be super annoying.
budy: i like hearing what you have to say
budy: yeah i’ll show you where i saw it
me: When I make my own open source EMR software that’ll be fixed.
budy: thank you soooo soooo much!!!!
budy: it was in a routine called createorchoosesubset
budy: aaah
budy: never crosses my mind!!!!
budy: or something like that
budy: crossed
me: Haha I’m glad, I really didn’t say anything of value on the phone but I’m glad that didn’t annoy you
me: That worked?
me: I always like hearing you whatever you have to say!
budy: lol no wonder it wasn’t finding anything 
me: You know it’s very rare for me to feel better after talking on the phone, but I guess you are special
budy: yup
me: So congrats ;)
me: Great!
me: Ok, yeah we can look at it!
me: Can we close this Sherlock?
budy: well i’m glad
me: ;) jk
budy: it’s in released code so was just curious 
budy: what are you doing now evan? sorry to bother you with this
budy: it was used like: h 3
budy: sure closing
me: 🤔
me: Now I’m just playing Zelda again, so you’re not bothering me at all!
me: I can look into it
me: I’d rather be helping you than playing games, I like helping people
me: That’s very mysterious
me: I’m glad that worked!
budy: also: no, i think it was of value!
budy: me too! thanks evan :)
me: Why would you want to h a 3?
budy: that sounds like fun though!
me: You’re just back at your house? You still have a while left at home! That’s nice!
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: yeah that’s true! it’s nice to just chill
budy: who knows
budy: we finished the puzzle we were working on today as well!
budy: can i ask you a question 
me: Haha well, I’m glad
me: Nice! What was it a puzzle of?
me: H3H3?
me: And yes!
me: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkm8Hteeh6M
budy: ￼do you remember this?
me: He h’s 3s all the time
budy: it was of a candy shop 
budy: oh you are right
me: Hm 🤔🤔🤔
me: Must be it
me: Doesn’t right a bell!
budy: ￼
me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: Oh. I guess it just waits. Interesting
budy: i was starting to forget it so had to ask!
me: Well that’s not that exciting then
me: What is that? Can you remind me?
budy: yeah...
budy: (honestly cannot remember)
budy: o well 
me: Well I guess it’s a mystery forever that nobody will ever remember oh well
me: o well¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: ok i’ll leave you be i’m gonna get back to work 
budy: i’m still here 
me: Haha well, I won’t distract you but you can text me whenever!
me: Still deicing, huh?
budy: haha well, i won’t distract you but you can text me whenever!
me: Maybe I will make cookies
me: ಠ_ಠ
me: Actually it’s just one big cookie
me: You’re such a nerd
budy: yupyup
me: But I like you
budy: yumyum
budy: ಠ_ಠ
me: Haha you’re great
me: What are you up to, Vidya?
me: Describe the people around you. What are they like? Where are they going and why?
budy: nothing really, i’m just reading and probably gonna sleep soon
budy: i hope my plants are alive 
budy: what are you up to evan
me: Did you text sowmya to water them?
me: Mm same basically. I’m just going to go to bed, I’m tired 😴 
budy: you’re like a real life prompt giver
me: Did you make some progress on STC?
budy: no i forgot 
budy: i’m terrible 
budy: yeah i’ve done a little! i still probably have quite a bit to go, but it’s going
budy: i want to finish before returning and i think it might be possible 
me: Oh well. I’m sure they’re fine
budy: my subset creation thing is not entirely right yet but hopefully i’ll get it tomorrow
budy: is the printing part really hard?
budy: i’ll tell you about them tomorrow
me: Cool! You can test the subset creation by printing from my routine: ZRU28658
budy: the people 
me: The printing isn’t too hard, you just have to work with some other random code.
me: Haha you’d better
me: I’m sure you can get it!
budy: yeah i think i’m getting there, i’ll probably ask you some more questions or will maybe have to arrange a private appointment office hours with you haha! 
me: Good. I need to know about both
me: Haha you are welcome to do either!
me: Maybe you have some new flowers
me: Any plans for tomorrow? I basically didn’t do any of the things I had to do today :|
budy: ok goodbye i am just turning my phone off because i’m going to rest my eyes
budy: goodbye and you are wonderful!
budy: oh no! well i’m sure you will get to them
budy: yeah my mom has called over some more family friends so i will meeting those fellow kids tomorrow
me: Sleep well :) have a nice flight!
budy: basically other people who i’ve known since i was very small
budy: and will try to do more stc :) 
budy: :)
budy: goodnight evan
budy: 😴 
me: STILL DEICING⁉️
me: You have a lot of family friends! That’s pretty neat!
budy: MAYBE ⁉️
me: Sweet dreams, Vidya 😴
me: You are wonderful too :) that plane’d better leave soon!
me: Like I said, I’ll believe it when you’re actually here!
budy: what are you up to today?
budy: planes moving
budy: goodbye goodbye 
budy: oh no it stopped:o
me: Oh no you jinxed it!
me: Hi Vidya! I am not really doing anything today. Maybe go to a movie with Andrew.
me: It’ll move again, I have faith
me: Sowmya texted me, I think she might be back! Maybe I’ll see I she wants to go to the movie too
budy: goodbye goodbye goodbye 
me: Other than that probably texting you.
me: goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye
me: What are you up to? Going to see your family friends?
me: Sowmya, Andrew, and I went to see Aquaman. Andrew was so excited, he loved it! It was good, but honestly I don’t think I could tell you what’s a good superhero movie and what’s a bad one 🤔
budy: yeah people are actually still at my house
budy: for “lunch”
budy: sounds like fun! that’s nice you were able to see a movie and do something together 
budy: whatchu up to now
budy: i think im gonna go see a movie too
me: Haha that’s a long lunch wow!
me: Feeling a little tired of people being over?
me: Yeah! It was good to get out! Now we are going to get dinner together at a taco place
me: Texas Tubb’s Taco Palace. Just like where you are I would imagine!
me: That’s fun! See a movie tonight? With your friends?
me: Also it was super weird- in the restaurant there’s an employee only door and when they come out of it they knock to warn people. Just as you texted me, some guy knocked with the same bzz bzz BZZZ pattern :0
me: That’s not that interesting actually :| sorry
budy: yeah it’s good to see them! but i always feel a little out of place around them (i’ve never been as outgoing and i guess girl-y as they are) but it was fun to see everyone and we looked at a lot of old pictures of us when we were little
budy: lol they’re all so photogenic and beautiful 😭 but anyways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: oooh i haven’t had texmex in madison yet
budy: how was it?
budy: yeah we were gonna see spiderverse but there were no tickets so we are seeing at 10 tomorrow
budy: we instead tried boba at 3 different places and then walked around the asian supermarket
budy: it was so fun!
budy: ￼there’s a whole side of an aisle for seaweed
budy: ￼even men’s tea
budy: it’s for men
budy: that’s cool about the bzz bzz BZZZ i’m glad you told me the observation
budy: no apologies needed :)
me: Well, sometimes it’s good to have friends who are very different from you! And haha I’m glad you got to relive “the good old days” in those old photos!
me: My friend Emma and I honestly have like nothing in common, but we mostly just talk about memories from like elementary and middle school haha so sorta the same
me: Still fun!
me: And yes, it is a pretty good Tex mex place! Like, I’ve had better, but it’s the best I’ve found in Madison! We can go sometime!
me: ￼OH! And for the record, I think this is a very nice picture of you
me: ....And also for the record, I do think you are beautiful
me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: i agree! it’s definitely good to have friends that are different than you and i’m glad i got to see them! 
me: Wow! Tea just for men! Now I can finally drink tea without my masculinity being called into question!
budy: i do like that picture as it reminds me of a very fun day and memory :)
me: You went to 3 boba places? I feel like I get sick of it after one!
me: Maybe that’s just because it wasn’t man tea
me: Yeah, it’s fun to see old friends regardless!
budy: thanks evan! i usually try not to think too much about appearances but i don’t know it gets to me sometimes
budy: well my sister, my friend jean and i each got one at three different places 
budy: yeah it’s for men! and seems to be for hangovers lol
budy: but yeah you must be allergic to non man tea
budy: do you sneeze at non man tea
me: Well, there are more important things than looks of course, but yeah, you’re pretty cute, don’t be bothered by it
me: Ah that makes much more sense!
budy: ￼￼￼
me: ^Not really, actually, but ok!
me: Yeah, I am allergic to it.
me: (The sun must be too effeminate for me as well)
budy: some examples of the pictures for your viewing pleasure (idk if you can tell which ones are me but haha)
budy: it was also funny to see our parents and what they wore in the ~90s~
budy: ￼i used to hate eating so this is my mom feeding me
budy: the sun is so effeminate makes sense
me: Oh wow! Haha those are so funny! I like the one of all of you dressed up!
me: I can tell which one is you, but only because you showed me pictures before!
me: Haha yeah that’s always fun, I saw a lot of photographs over the break, many of my parents in like the 80s- they were very funny
me: Aw you needed to be in a swing to be fed! Also you definitely look like a little boy in that picture haha
me: Still cute!
me: Yeah the sun is just such a girly presence that it causes an allergic reaction. I’m too manly
me: I do not have any baby pictures on hand to show you, sorry :/
budy: yeah i definitely looked like a boy whenever i wasn’t wearing a dress 
budy: had the classic bucket haircut too! 
budy: bowl cut or whatever you call it
budy: i guess i might be manly enough to drink man tea
budy: aww sad
budy: i have some
budy: ￼￼
budy: wow
budy: hey you have work tomorrow! that’s gonna be fun! and it’s the last day of 2018
budy: woaaaah
me: Haha yeah the classic bowl cut! 
me: As opposed to my super stylish 10 year old zoo tycoon playing haircut
me: Well, you could maybe try it but only because you looked boyish without a dress when you were four.
me: Wow! I’m glad you have pictures of me to share with yourself!
me: I know! :| I don’t really feel like it, but at least it’s only one day and then another mini weekend!
me: And then you’ll be back!!!
me: Yeah, I wonder if David will say, “I haven’t seen you since last year!”
me: Classic dad joke
budy: sounds like something he would say
budy: yay mini weekend!
budy: also remember to get a picture of evan at a party 
budy: we need to see marikas new cat aaah
me: I won’t forget! It’s super important.
me: Then you can judged if I am photogenic and cute
me: Oh wow! We do need to meet this cat!
me: For some reason I haven’t been getting Snapchat notifications but that’s a pretty cat!
me: Also that’s cool your sister made a game! Wow! What did she use to make it?
budy: yeah i will judge
budy: 👩‍⚖️ 
budy: it’s in java
budy: happy last day of the year evan! (happy old years)
budy: i am thankful for many things this year, including you, so thanks for being a part of my 2018
me: Happy old year’s! Haha didn’t know that was a thing!
me: But either way, you have certainly been one of the best parts of 2018 for me :)
me: Man, it’s really quiet today, I want to go home :| I haven’t gotten an email from outside Epic since like noon on Friday.
me: Also that’s cool, java is good stuff! I’m impressed her high school even teaches java!
me: And yes, I expect my picture to be carefully examined
budy: Yeah, I think they actually learn everything in java
budy: How’s the day going now?
budy: I saw into the spiderverse today and it was so good!!!!
budy: I am so impressed, I really liked it a lot and the story was very good, so many good things about it!
budy: And then I tried these spicy noodles, I am bringing some back so maybe you can try them, but they were really spicy!
budy: Anyways hope your New Years eve is going well and swell
me: Is it like AP computer science?
me: My day is going well! I am leaving now haha
me: It’s really snowy :| so I’m glad my car is broken!
me: If it’s too snowy I might not go to the party :(
me: Wow! I really want to see it! I really don’t understand what it is about but if you liked it I’m sure it’s very good!
me: The animation looks really cool too *-*
me: I’ll have to see it
me: Wow! I’d like to try these noodles! What kind were they? They were spicier than the Denver noodles?
me: Other than the snow and work my day is all well and swell :) hope your New Years day is well and swell as well!
budy: she took ap comp sci last year and i think this was the continuation
budy: yeah sowmya was telling me about the snow 
budy: where’s the party?
me: Wow does she want to do comp sci stuff?
me: I actually have no idea where it is or even if it is still on
budy: what language did you learn in high school? she is saying ap test was in java
budy: it seems to be what she enjoys the most so it seems like she wants to do that
budy: she’s only a sophomore rn though
budy: also did you actually check your car yet?
budy: the animation was amazing!!! the graphic style is so cool and the story was also really exciting, another superhero movie but it really was quite different 
budy: they were some korean hot chicken noodles or something we can try then
budy: them
budy: i’m not exactly sure which was spicier 
budy: kinda sucks that it’s snowing tonight though!
budy: make sure to get that pic if you go to the party!!!
me: Jeez I was so tired for some reason, I just slept for like 3 hours
me: It’s not like today was hard!
me: And then I had to log time :|
me: I didn’t even really learn any language in high school. I taught myself some java tho
me: That’s cool, she still has time to figure stuff out!
me: I have not checked my car yet, I was going to but I didn’t cuz now it’s snowing
me: So I guess I’m still going to go now since Lloyd’s apartment is downtown!
me: I didn’t forget! Don’t worry! I know it’s important!
me: What are you up to?
me: ￼Here’s your picture Vidya! Lots of people are here: Jerry and I took an office mate ski shot, Desmond is here and doesn’t look like David, David is wearing an orange suit and is undefeated with Lloyd at beer pong! Hope you’re having a good New Years!
budy: ooh are you there now??
me: ￼￼
me: Yes!
budy: yeah good you can walk!
me: Yeah I took an Uber. It’s too cold!
me: What are you up to?
budy: playing board games with friends :)
budy: my rice friends are having a party too but couldn’t go because downtown 
budy: and missing you guys!
budy: but having fun
budy: those are some good pics
budy: is that nick from hosting?
budy: you should stick with him! 
budy: and jerry looks happy!
budy: lloyd looks cool and david looks halloweeny
me: That’s too bad but I’m glad you are having fun nonetheless!
me: Miss you too!
budy: thanks for the picture updates though
me: I told Emily I was taking pictures for you and when I told her you were still in Houston, she said “Fuck you” so that’s from Emily 👌
budy: are you having fun
me: Yeah! Stick with nick! He said he didn’t recognize me without you there too haha
me: Yes, I am having fun. Still would be better with you!
me: Are you having fun?
budy: wait really??? he didn’t recognize you!
budy: he probably wouldn’t recognize me i guess without you
budy: yeah!!!
me: Haha yeah we only count as a unit, I guess
me: I’m glad you are having fun!
me: 3 minutes to midnight!
me: Happy new year!!!!!!!!
me: Thanks for being just about the best part of this year, I look forward to another year with you :)
budy: happy new year!!!
budy: me too!!!
budy: (^ᴗ^)ノ
budy: ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
budy: ◕‿◕
budy: is it still snowing? is it a lot?
me: ◕‿◕
me: Nope, it only snowed like an inch and it’s done now
me: It’s good snowball snow though. Very sticky!
me: So you’ll be back tomorrow and we could make some snowballs
me: I left the party, Andrew was really drunk haha I really didn’t drink enough, but I’m happily at home now!
me: Glad to have a day off now :0
me: You should rest so you can wake up early and be with your family before you leave :) see you soon, Vidya!
budy: you are very right
budy: glad you are happily at home 
budy: yeah i didn’t drink anything but still was a fun time :) 
budy: sticky snowballs sound so fun
me: They are fun! Glad you had a fun time too :)
me: Well, did you judge my picture? Am I photogenic and/or cute? ;)
budy: yes
budy: (even if i could barely identify you without me) 
budy: although i think you could use a sparkly gold bow
budy: (just kidding you’re still photogenic and/or cute according to the judgement)
me: Haha I mean, you might be right that I’d be photogenicer and/or cuter with a bow tie. And also photogenicer and/or cuter with you.
me: But glad to know the judgement passed ;)
me: Thanks, Vidya!
me: Anyway, yes, get some sleep, spend some time with your family tomorrow morning!
me: Sweet dreams and happy 2019!
budy: sweet dreams evan
budy: i’m on the plane! how’s the day going?
me: Hi! Pretty good! I have not really been doing anything.
me: How has your day been? Did you get to have brunch with your family? ;)
me: Have a nice flight Vidya!
budy: in madison!!!
me: Yay! You made it!
me: How was your flight?
budy: meh
budy: i hope i find my bag
me: Great, now your bag is missing?
budy: apparently it got here earlier so they have to unlo
budy: ck the office 
budy: i trust the madison airport though 
me: How did it get here earlier but you didn’t get here earlier?
me: Hmm... well, yeah I trust Madison
me: Not so much O’Hare
me: That’s so annoying! Did that happen to everyone’s?
budy: in uber! yeah some people 
budy: probably others who had transfers
me: That’s weird. Jeez, sorry your trip has been so long! :(
me: I’m glad you are headed home now!
budy: just drove by your apt
budy: yeah it’s fine i’m glad i’m making it!
me: Yeah, I saw! Did you see me waving?
budy: yeah 
me: Oh good I’m glad!
me: ;)
me: But yes, now you can check on your plants!
budy: yay
me: I still wish I could’ve taken you home from the airport!
me: Are you tired?
budy: idk kind of
budy: don’t worry about it!!!
budy: it was super smooth to take an uber
budy: and honestly im glad no one was picking me up
budy: because it would have been such a long wait 
me: I’m not apologizing, I just wish I could’ve seen you
me: And yeah, Ubers from the airport are pretty easy here
me: I took an Uber from the Houston airport and it was the worst, I had two guys cancel on me before a third guy actually picked me up. Katrina was so mad at me. Classic. So relatively, the Madison airport is super great for that!
budy: oh no!!!!
budy: that sounds super stressful 
me: Yeah less than ideal
budy: getting to houston airport is so hard
budy: i’ve tried a few different methods
me: And the Denver airport is like 40 minutes outside the city so any Uber is super expensive
me: The train works I guess but it is known for breaking down frequently
budy: oh airports
me: They’re the worst
me: Well, I dunno, I kind of like airports
me: They’re inconvenient but I enjoy being in them. It feels very, like, self-contained. Like I have all my stuff, there’s food there, anything I could need! And I don’t have to do anything but wait! It’s lovely
me: No need to worry about anything outside the airport
budy: that’s true!
budy: i’m back in my apartment 
budy: hooray 
budy: plants watered, family called everything’s ok
me: Great! Journey finally completed!
me: Now you can rest
budy: :) yeah
budy: ￼
me: Wow! It makes me think of that bridge into Hogwarts. The snow makes it so nice!
me: Wait! Where’d you go? I just walked over the bridge just to find you and you were gone!
budy: im here!
budy: i havent moved
budy: are you still here aaah
me: What?! How did I completely miss you?! :( well, now I have a call but it should be pretty quick
me: ￼
budy: wow!!!
budy: i got the menu to work!!!
budy: it was something dumb
me: Nice! What was it?
budy: 2 things
- needed extra routine to set context
- had to pass in menu parameters
budy: it works good now
me: Ah! Good stuff. I was going to suggest that it was the context not being set.
me: Glad it works now!
me: You’d best send me a picture of your purple plant when you get home, Vidya!
budy: no
me: 😢
me: I want to know! Your plants are important to me!
me: They really are. Because they’re important to you!
budy: they like you too
budy: are you still here
budy: im thinking of leaving 
me: I’m glad!
me: I left: I drove with Andrew and he tends to leave earlier than I do. So I left!
me: You should go too
me: I wish my car were ok
me: Haha well, I’m really glad I got to see you too! I’d almost forgotten what you looked like! Not really! But I’m happy I got to see you :)
me: :) well, I really enjoyed talking to you too! I’m glad I make you happy, you make me very happy too
budy: i enjoyed talking to you, you make me very happy and i appreciate that! 
budy: ok
budy: thanks for calling!
budy: i think i will head back 
budy: also btw sowmya was telling me about how calm you make her feel too!
budy: ￼￼i caved
budy: i hope it’s ok!
budy: and i agree
budy: anyways you are a good one my friend
budy: oh i do that too...
me: Yeah! Work is not as fun
budy: very good
me: As being home with your plants
me: I will check my car when I get home!
me: Haha I’m glad Sowmya thinks I’m calming too! I have been told I have a calming presence.
budy: finally!!!!
budy: yeah i should spend time with them
me: Well, thanks, you are a good one, Vidya, I like you a lot
me: I know :( I tend to ignore my problems, have you noticed that? It’s bad
budy: overall i’m very glad you ended up recovering and coming to work today! it was great to see you, i bet jerrys sick of seeing me in your office lol
me: Yeah your plants are pretty cool. I’d like to see them, it’s been a while
budy: im done!!!!! just testing script now
budy: it’s bad indeed
budy: hooooooray
budy: how’s the car
budy: yeah they are
budy: (until i find a bug probably...)
me: Maybe I should spend more time in your and Brett’s office and annoy him
me: Nice job! Hooooooooray!!
me: Well, now it’s not your job to find bugs
budy: here are the pics
budy: yeah you are totally welcome to do that
budy: you’re welcome 
budy: i guess you’re right
budy: hehehe
budy: but yeah honestly i am sorry, let me know if i am ever boring you or saying nonsense things like detailing how each of my plants are...
budy: yikes
me: Yeah! I will! I guess it’s just more common that you walk past my office, huh?
me: No! Don’t worry! Haha I love hearing about your plants! I really do! I can tell you care a lot about them, and anything you care about is something that I want to learn more about!
me: So please tell me about your plants :D
me: I was also wondering... do you know where the break room chalk went? I thought it’d be fun for us to make a big drawing of (probably a giraffe or) something
me: But yes, anything you think is worth saying is something I think is worth listening to
budy: i have another question 
budy: how do you document opt so it wont pop up in ezparae
budy: parse
budy: is it with declares
budy: or assumes?
me: Yeah put it as assumed
me: Or assumes whatever
budy: ok thanks!
budy: also that’s very kind of you, but honestly let me know 
budy: i really like what you have to say
budy: that would be really fun!
budy: i don’t know where the chalk went but we should do waffles again
me: Haha well, I’ll let you know, but you really don’t annoy me!
me: Yeah! We could do waffle Wednesday next Wednesday?
me: I finally got outlook on my phone haha
budy: yeah let’s do it!
budy: also hooray now i have actually submitted!
budy: i don’t know what to do with my life, all i did before was feel guilty about not doing stc, and then did stc
budy: but now i am so free!!!
me: Nice job! Yeah, you can probably just go home now.
me: I’m glad you submitted!
me: I feel like I have a lot to do today. I just keep getting new things to do! 😰
budy: yeah everyone just left you a lot of work i guess
budy: haha i guess i actually do have work to do since i didn’t do anything yesterday
budy: want to get lunch after your call 
budy: what are your transportation plans 
me: Well, I think Andrew is going to pick me up and we will go home
me: But I can pick up my car after that!
me: It might even work!
budy: ok cool!
me: Ok cool!
me: What are your transportation plans?
budy: im at home!
budy: teleportation!
budy: did you get your car?
me: ￼Got it!
me: Yeah it works now too!
me: I mean it probably will fully break soon but I won’t think about it
me: How was teleporting home? That sounds interesting
budy: wow nice 
budy: he looks good!!!
budy: it was good teleporting 
budy: ￼
budy: this morning!
me: Sorta missing his face but oh well!
me: That’s a very nice sunrise!
me: It looks so warm and inviting except for the snow!
me: So you want to play in the snow this weekend? Want to do anything tomorrow after work?
budy: yeah what should we do? :D
budy: i will have to do groceries
budy: and yes to snow activities 
budy: any ideas?
me: Cool! Hmm 🤔 well, groceries are always fun haha
me: Well... we could...
me: Go Bowling
Mini golf without Jesse
Go to Milwaukee
Go to Chicago
Go to the house on the rock
Drawings from suggestion box
Build something with arduino
Find a way to light my hallway
Build a snowman
Ice fishing
Walk across the lake
Play Mario party
Netflix black mirror bandersnatch
Play board games
Show you how tree thing/purpose box works
Make a painting together
Go to a play
Go to a comedy show/open mic night
Read a book out loud
Create an epic scavenger hunt
Go Geocaching
me: (I wrote some things down)
me: ;)
budy: that all sounds amazing!
budy: such good ideas
me: So you want to do all those things tomorrow?
me: Ok cool
budy: yeah 
me: Sounds like a busy day!
me: I guess, alternatively, we could spread those things out over like a few weekends. If we did that, what do you think we should start with for tomorrow?
budy: idk they are all too great
budy: what do you want to do the most?
me: I don’t know! I guess let’s let randomness decide.
me: I’m going to have to SU your purpose in life box, but for now this works:
me: ￼It said 7 which corresponds to “Build something with Arduino.”
me: But the nice thing about a random choice is now we can assess how we feel if we are forced to do that thing. Do you want to do that or something else? ;)
budy: sounds good to me :)
budy: my purpose in life box isn’t working, it might have got jostled on the way over sigh
budy: but that sounds like fun!
me: Oh no! Ok, well, we can fix it.
me: I have a lot of stuff at my apartment, so I guess we could do that here?
budy: yeah!
budy: how’s the day going evan 
me: Hey sorry I’m kinda in a bad mood. I have a lot of problems (for work and otherwise) and I’m just annoyed that I can’t fix any of them
budy: i could see that you seemed pretty stressed, is there anything i can help you with?
budy: it’s ok though sometimes those days come 
me: Hey! Haha I guess I was trying to talk to you before David showed up
me: Do you want to “build stuff with arduino” or anything else?
me: You could come to my apartment!
me: I know you said you have to do grocery shopping so I suppose you could do that and then come over? Or I can go shopping with you (so much fun!)
me: Anyway, yeah sorry we completely failed to come up with a plan before leaving! Let me know what you want to do!
budy: i like hanging out with just you too, definitely have to do it tomorrow
budy: ok sounds good!
budy: nothing big, are you doing something?
budy: there’s so many cars
me: Everyone is very done after this short week
me: Sounds good to what? Come over after groceries? Or shop together?
budy: comeover after
budy: i guess i have to make dinner too
me: Ok! Sounds good.
budy: but also if you are tired we can do something later
me: We need to try the spicy noodles sometime too
me: I am not tired. Are you? We definitely could do stuff another day if you’d prefer!
budy: i feel like i’m getting sick again meh
budy: but i want to hang out
me: Oh no! :(
budy: so maybe we can still do it? also i asked since you seemed pretty stressed but i would definitely want to
me: I want to hang out too, I am perfectly fine
me: Yeah we can still do whatever you would like. It can be pretty chill
budy: i think sowmya wants to do something too hmm
me: Hmm... well, what do you want to do? We could hang out with her or do something just us?
budy: idk eithers fine
budy: we could do a different list item that she might be more interested in i guess 
me: We certainly could! Is that what you want to do? If we did that we could do arduino stuff and play in the snow this weekend
budy: anything works 
budy: what do you think?
budy: what are you eating for dinner?
me: Well, I like our times just the two of us, but I suppose we could hang out with Sowmya tonight then do other stuff this weekend. If you want
me: No idea!
me: What are you eating for dinner?
budy: i was trying to decide what to do
budy: what do you usually eat just curious 
budy: i was wondering since jerry brought it up
me: We could go to/make dinner with Sowmya maybe
me: Well, I guess I tend to make easy things that don’t really count as cooking. I mean like spaghetti with pasta sauce or even just cereal when I’m really lazy :|
me: It just takes so much time to cook! That’s what I don’t like!
me: Do you want to get dinner with Sowmya?
budy: i really want sushi so i might just get it from woodmans
budy: but that sounds good too!
budy: i like the idea of making something 
budy: maybe we can just do something rather than eat
budy: but yeah what would you want to do?
budy: i’m just really not sure 
budy: ok i’m gonna get going to grocery 
budy: and i’ll try to eat fast
me: Ok sounds good!
me: Yeah, it’s easier when it’s just the two of us
me: Well... you still want to make something but include Sowmya?
me: Or play games with Sowmya?
budy: i could see us doing games or maybe she would like bandersnatcj
budy: we could try making something too
budy: what would/should/cab we make?
budy: lol i’m still at home
budy: aaah
me: Planning things is so hard!
budy:  i know
budy: it’s so easy with you 
me: It’s easy with you!
me: Oh haha so in sync!
budy: that’s what i was gonna say
budy: anyways i’m actually leaving and am in the car
me: 😮
me: Ok, well, you can get groceries, I guess I’ll tell sowmya we will at least not do dinner
budy: how about we just tell her we are gonna hang out at your apartment 
me: Yeah I was going to say something like that
me: Except I was going to suggest your apartment
budy: i do want to make dinner with you at your place at some point too, maybe we could do that tomorrow?
me: (That way, when she gets tired you don’t have to drive home with her too)
budy: let’s do your apartment 
me: Ok any particular reason?
budy: it’s been so long since we’ve hung out there
me: Haha that’s true
budy: also she’s not home yet
budy: and i might want to call it an earlier night than we typically do
me: Ok, well that sounds good. We can of course do stuff tomorrow as well
me: Andrew got home too
budy: lol maybe sowmya will be interested in making something too?
me: Yeah, that sounded like fun!
me: Well, we can see!
me: Why do we have to hang out with anyone other than each other? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: she seems to be ok with it so yeah!
budy: let’s keep it in mind
budy: groceries successful now i am back and eatingyum yum
me: Cool! Yeah we should definitely do that :D
me: Did you get sushi?
budy: i did!
me: Wow! Does woodmans have good sushi?
budy: it’s pretty good!
me: Wow! Woodmans is the most exciting place ever!
me: Are you guys done with dinner and such?
budy: i’ve been done since 7:20 but sowmyas still getting ready
budy: i think we will leave soon
budy: im getting really sleepy honestly 
me: Ok! Just making sure! It is getting late!
budy: i might have to leave earlier rather than later 
me: Are you feeling better?
budy: i really think i got a cold 
me: Yeah, I guess it is late :/ well, I mean I really would understand if you just want to hang out some other time.
budy: yeah maybe you guys can still hang out
me: Well, I mean, if you’re tired we can just cancel doing anything
me: I just wanted to hang out with you really!
me: Ugh, it’s so easy just the two of us but somehow gets so difficult with others!
budy: i might have to cancel
:( i’m really tired and my nose is stuffy/have a headache 
budy: my family was all sick over vacation so probably caught it from there 
budy: yeah hopefully if i sleep a lot i will be better tomorrow
me: I know it’s good to spend time with more people, but it sometimes seems like you’re the only one it’s easy to spend time with
budy: yeah i really did want to hang out especially since you were feeling bad today
me: Yeah, you can get some rest and we can spend time together tomorrow, ok?
me: Yeah, I really wanted to spend time with you, and I appreciate that!
budy: and yes, somehow i feel like there’s so much that we can to do together and everything seems to get in the way
me: It’s ok, I’m sorry it didn’t work out
budy: yeah i’m sorry too i feel kinda bad about it
me: I know, there’s so much I want to do with you!
me: Don’t worry! It’s really ok!
me: I don’t blame you at all (or sowmya) it’s just complicated!
me: I want you to be at your best!
budy: are you feeling ok too? i wanted to make you happy too
me: You do make me very happy! :D you’re so sweet and I feel so comfortable with you!
me: I’m frustrated by a lot of things right now, but you make me feel much better!
budy: ok! well then we will have to do something tomorrow
budy: hope i don’t add to frustrations though! thanks for understanding 
budy: i’m glad you feel that way, i would say the same for you 
me: You don’t add to my frustrations at all! Don’t worry! You are so amazing and help me so much
budy: what are you doing now 
budy: i’m kinda sad we didn’t get to talk much today
budy: can i call you actually 
budy: nvm see you later! sorry again!
budy: that was way too long i’m sorry! take rest!
me: Oh no! Sorry I sorta hung up on you!
me: No I like talking to you!
me: But I’m also definitely falling asleep!
budy: oh i hit the button at the same time 
me: We should rest so we can do stuff tomorrow!
me: Oh haha well then that’s ok
budy: glad i’m that boring thanks evan 
me: 😭
me: No you’re very interesting to me!!
budy: good night 😴 
me: Good night, Vidya 😴
budy: hi there hello 
me: Hi hello!
me: How did you sleep? Do you feel better?
budy: i feel still a bit sick but also it’s an amazing day
budy: i think i can try to be there by 1
me: Oh, I’m sorry. Yes, it is a nice day!
me: Ok, cool, yeah, no rush, just let me know when you are on your way!
budy: if i bring my computer and stuff could we keep it in your apartment?
me: Yup!
budy: ok i’ll let you know when i actually leave 
budy: i’m leaving now 
me: Cool! See you soon!
budy: here
me: Cool I will be down in a second!
me: Thanks for hanging out with me, Vidya! It was a really nice day and we did so many fun things! I’m glad it worked out this time because I really love just being with you :) I hope you get some rest and feel better tomorrow (And we could construct an art installation if you would like)!
budy: i just got home
budy: i had a great time today, i just like being around you hehehe
budy: i’m so glad for every little bit of time i get to spend with you because you are truly special
budy: yes, i will try to rest up, and you do the same
budy: also your floor was very comfy and i could have been there forever anyways i’m very impressed with how i haven’t passed out yet 
me: Hehe you spoke too soon I did pass out!
me: Oh my face feels so dry!
me: I’m glad you made it back safe and yes, I feel the same! You are so special to me, every bit of time I get with you is great
me: My floor is fantastic! You’re welcome to sleep there whenever you’d like!
me: How are you feeling, Vidya?
budy: pretty bad uuugh
budy: how are you feeling 
me: Oh no :( I’m sorry. Well, try to rest today. I want you to get better
me: I am feeling perfectly fine
me: Is there anything I can get for you or do to make you feel better?
budy: i’m pretty sick, i really can’t believe i’m sick again :(
budy: but i felt bad yesterday morning and then got better so let’s see
me: Oh, I’m sorry :( hopefully you will improve throughout the day
me: Can I do anything for you?
budy: bleh i just feel really bad
budy: i was looking forward to working on the thing with you 😢
budy: but i guess it happens 
budy: thanks though!
budy: and yesterday was so fun! i’m so happy we got to do things
me: Well, let me know if I can do anything for you, I’d be very happy to help!
me: It’s really ok! It happens! We will work on it later :)
me: Yesterday was the best weekend I’ve had in a little while (because I haven’t seen you in a few weekends!)
budy: uuuh what should i do to feel better 
budy: agreed 
me: It’s your head hurting still?
me: I don’t know why I didn’t get a notification when you texted me :0 I’m sorry! I didn’t think I was ignoring you 😭
me: Yeah it is a pretty good library! We were sitting on the top level and the top level is just an actual art gallery, not even a library anymore!
me: We will have to check it out!
me: Now we are at Colectivo.
me: What are you up to?
budy: ooh nice! yeah we will have to check it out! 
i am still at home
budy: i’m gonna to make food now so that should be good :)
me: Yeah! We will check it out!
budy: i’m feeling better! hooray 
me: Making food sounds good!
me: Do you cook? I cook.
me: Oh! I’m so glad! Just sleeping helped?
budy: no i don’t cook :(
me: “Just ignore it, it’ll go away.”
me: I got some tape today too but it’s not perfect
me: Oh dang, well, I know how to make potato pancakes
budy: my head is still a little woozy but yeah you are right 
budy: just ignore it’ll go away 
budy: tape?
budy: how’s the day going 
me: In case someone wanted to draw lines on walls
me: That’s good! I’m sure it’ll go away soon.
budy: now who would do that 
me: My day is going well. Haven’t been doing much at all
me: I am helping Sowmya with STC at the library
budy: cool sounds chill! i still haven’t been to that library
budy: but it seems nice and good 
me: I know, maybe that’s silly.
me: How are you feeling?
budy: haha i was just about to text you
budy: i’m very drained
me: So in sync!
budy: i just cooked the worst food bleh
me: Oh no! What did you make?
budy: spaghetti squash but didn’t know you take the skin off
me: And I’m sorry you are drained, hopefully today has been a good resting day
budy: and baked some chicken but accidentally poured the whole rosemary container on there 
me: Hmm... so good to know you don’t eat the skin of spaghetti squash.
me: Oh no! That sounds pretty not good :(
me: Do you even cook?
budy: and then i got sriracha right on the white part of my sweater
budy: clearly not
budy: oh well
me: Oh no! That sounds like a disaster overall :(
budy: what are you doing 
budy: yeah 
me: Well, I still think you’re a good chef. Just not this time I suppose
me: I’m at my apartment with Sowmya
me: What are you up to now?
budy: do you cook
budy: idk pretty bored honestly but 
budy: idk
me: Yeah my signature dish is potato pancakes
budy: ￼
me: Oh :| yeah I’m not really doing anything that interesting
budy: ￼
budy: woooosshh
budy: probably more interesting than my day lol
me: Woooosh!!
me: Wow when was that?
budy: can’t remember 
budy: honestly i can’t remember what you look like 
me: Oh no :,(
me: It’s been too long since I’ve seen you
me: You should make a random drawing prompt and we can draw and send each other pictures of what we drew
budy: that sounds fun :)
me: Ok!
me: I have to see you at least once every 24 hours
budy: well the one from yesterday was good!
budy: draw an animal that is half sheep half sea anemone
me: Oh! Ok! Let’s do it. Go!
budy: i made something 
budy: how’s it going 
me: ￼
me: Done! With a few distractions from Sowmya
budy: ￼lol
budy: so adorable i love the bell and snorkel 
me: Hahaha wow he’s so wooly! With anemone wool!
budy: yeah 🤷‍♀️ 
budy: i tried
me: Hahaha I love it!
budy: there’s some lil fish in mine too
me: I see you also included a little fishy!
me: Oh yeah! I saw that!
budy: i like how long the snorkel is
me: You got to really showcase your love of branching abstract patterns in this sheep!
me: Hahah I had to make sure he could breathe!
budy: yup i always find a way
budy: haha that’s true 
me: It became very clear early on that an anemone sheep would be a nightmarish creation
me: Sort of lovecraftian
me: Hahaha
me: Well your sheep is lovely!
budy: i like yours!
budy: are you guys still working 
me: Sowmya just finished her project! And will head home now
budy: nice!
budy: well that was fun :)
me: Yeah! I would not want to see one of those irl but it was a fun exercise!
me: We both had the same interpretation of what that would look like: just a sheep but the wool is anemone tentacles haha
budy: definitely the most obvious thing 
me: You could also do a sea anemone but the tentacles are wool ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: true...
budy: hmmm
budy: well i’m gonna sleeeeep
budy: goodnight evan, it was quite weird to not be with you today but i guess it’s impractical to see each other at least once every 24 hrs...
me: Yes, you should get some rest, Vidya, I want for you to be at your best!
me: Yeah! It’s odd to spend a perfectly good day without you, but there are many more weekends to come!
me: I will see you tomorrow, I look forward to that :)
me: Goodnight 😴
budy: yeah maybe we should take a break from spending time together 
budy: we spend too much together
budy: but we need space
budy: -san cisco
budy: haha see you tomorrow evan 😴
me: Hahaha aw :( well, I am always happy when I spent time with you but if you think San Cisco is right, then... you should stay at your place
me: Or at least stay in your office ;)
me: See you tomorrow Vidya!
budy: 😊
me: Jerry opened our window on Friday (which is an odd choice to begin with) and left it open all weekend. Now our office is like 10 degrees lower than anywhere else :|
me: Also my search didn’t finish I’m going to see if it’s possible to have it start from where it died
budy: hmmm
budy: i don’t think i can eat w you today :,(
me: Why not? I don’t have anything at 11
budy: i can’t read
me: Haha UC Davis emailed me back about the billing thing. They were just in the wrong environment and figured it out themselves!
me: So I fixed it 😉
budy: yay!
budy: question: i want to write an ahk to make replacements to the license count sxript
budy: what would be the ebst way to so this
budy: maybe kdiffing myseld is the best way
me: Hmm... well how do you do it by hand? If it’s like you have to replace each instance of one thing with another then maybe you can open it in notepad++ and just do find and replace
me: If it’s more complex logic we could make a c# program to do it!
me: Also I spoke too soon earlier, my outlook is being really slow to do anything and won’t send messages
budy: is there anyway to find more than one line in notepad ++
budy: also do you just have to make sure it’s on the find and replace tab before starting the script 
me: You can replace all
me: You can start just from the file explorer, make it copy the file you have selected, add something to its name, edit in notepad++ (for this, if you do shift F10, it is as if you right clicked on it), then do ^r opens right to replace
me: I am going to talk on the phone but mostly just do nothing!
budy: are you doing anything today evan?
budy: my script worked when i tried it again¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: Are you doing anything?
budy: oh cool! nope nothing much
budy: i have a question about stc
budy: why would my temporary global not be able to handle more than 1mb of data
budy: i searched in the companion but i thought that was the point of using global variablea
budy: ￼hmm did you know this !???
me: Yeah! It’s kinda dumb! Temporary globals have that limit but real globals don’t.
me: Are you saving more than 1mb of data??!
budy: shane marked it as an issue
me: Also you’re working on STC? Gross!
budy: and i thought i did something really big wrong 
budy: sowmya’s working on it so i figured i would resolve issues too
me: Hmm... Shane marked that as an issue? Is it just with one specific one of the globals?
budy: was your call ok!
budy: he just said my searches would fail if there was more than 1mb
me: Yup, it was fine, just pretty standard.
me: Hmm, well, I guess you can just like count the number of things found and quit if it gets too big
me: I don’t remember if I even did that though.
budy: im just gonna use the larger option i guess
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: i also just learned that you need to provide instructions for user if they type ?
me: Oh yeah that!
me: Yeah I guess that’s easy enough to just make it bigger. Maybe I did do that I don’t remember
budy: also the prompt for print ept vs ser was not acceptable but easy enough to change 
me: Jeez! ? Prompts sounds like so much work! 😰
me: That’s like actually new functionality
budy: oh wait no i meant that the whole menu thing i did was not acceptable 
me: Yeah, did you see what I did for making my prompts different? Is really sketchy but it works!
me: Oh the menu was not good!
me: So you have to check based on the subset name what master file it is?
budy: well it works but they want it to be just automatically detecting which is fine
budy: i really only have one issue i don’t know hiw to fix
me: Ok, yeah, that’s sad you went out of your way to make the menu!
me: What issue is that?
budy: it says my printing a provider subset doesn’t work but i know it does 😢
budy: he says it has 0 results
me: 🤔
budy: i’m thinking maybe he meant print to disk didn’t work
me: Well, can you reproduce the issue?
me: Did you try recycling the app pools?
budy: were you able to open the document .doc
budy: lmao it’s busted 
me: Yup, oh... this happened to me too actually: did you make sure to use the shared temporary global and NOT release it?
budy: oh! i should have remembered that from debugging
budy: oops
budy: thanks!!! what are you up to now?
me: Ah! Can’t forget that!
me: Glad I could technical problem solve you
me: I am trying to create a data visualization application. I was looking on r/dataisbeautiful and they do a monthly data vis challenge. This month it’s using this data set on the oldest people in the world:
me: http://www.grg.org/Adams/C.HTM
me: So I’m testing with that (although there’s nothing to test right now)
budy: you mean you haven’t finished making the app yet so there’s nothing to test
me: Yes, but it’s good to have a use case in mind
budy: ahhh ok
budy: well that’s really cool!!!
budy: that’s an interesting data set too
budy: just to think about 
me: Well, it’s probably really pointless. I just want it for myself. Maybe I should work in my game instead
me: I dunno!
me: Have you thought at all about what the lights in my hall should actually… do?
budy: seems cool! you should do it if you want
budy: hmm maybe they could visualize something too
me: Well, I just don’t know if there’s anything I could do that R or d3.js don’t already do.
me: Hmm... they could! What could they visualize? That’s interesting- like it could be something where if I am leaving the apartment it displays different colors for like how cold it is. Something like that (But more interesting!)
budy: that’s what i was gonna type hmm
budy: hmm i have a funny idea
budy: might be silly 
me: What is it?
budy: hmm i’ll think about it some more
budy: also for the data thing, i think anything you think of is brilliant
me: Oh! Well, I like silly ideas! I can’t wait to hear it!
me: Haha I’m glad you think so ;) I was thinking it might be interesting to have it be aimed more towards natural language processing, like charting the sentiment plots but nicer
me: I don’t think R or matlab or anything is really good at working with text.
budy: i seeee
budy: cooooool
budy: ￼
budy: you make everything good! even potato pancake
me: Hahah I’m glad you think I make things good!
me: Sorry I fell asleep early last night!
me: Did you already get lunch? You are not in your office!
budy: im workig incass
budy: are you free
budy: i am free from now until 12!
budy: im on the couches upstairs 
me: Hey you can probably park in my building. Just on the first level is temporary parking
budy: got to my car 
me: Oh good! It was fun to hang out tonight! Sorry it’s so late now!! I enjoy spending time with you very much, we will just have to hang out past midnight on Friday or Saturday but for now get some rest and I will see you tomorrow!
me: Let me know when you get home safely!
budy: :)
budy: goodnight evan
budy: i am home
me: Oh! We could’ve done waffle Wednesday! Oh no!
me: The people are going to lose faith
budy: 😢
budy: my computer is updating aaah
me: Oh no! That is counterproductive to working on STC.
me: I feel so unmotivated. I want to work on something I care about.
budy: you don’t care everywhere?
budy: he submitted it!!!
budy: he changed it 
me: What did who submit?
budy: david
budy: are you doing anything today?
budy: because after this i don’t have too much to do if you want to do something!
me: Hey! Hmm, well, I don’t have much, but I guess I’ve just been feeling pretty dissatisfied with myself today and I feel like working on coding projects would help me feel better. So, we could definitely hang out if you’d like, but I want to feel like I’m working towards something if that makes sense. So like the wall light thing or some other project. Did you have something in mind to do?
budy: yeah! i guess you should keep working on lexeme
budy: i’ll try to go to the store and find the tape, maybe we can try to work on the light thing another day
budy: but yeah i would love to work on the light thing whenever you have time/want to!
me: Well, I mean, I’m sure if you came over I’d start feeling better. But maybe just another day would be better, I wouldn’t be very entertaining I don’t think
me: Yeah, I think it will be really great when it’s done!
me: I guess Andrew gets back tonight haha
me: Is there anything this weekend we should try to do?
budy: youre always interesting to me! 
budy: are you feeling better 
budy: i would always want to help you feel better:)
budy: but ya whatchu doing?
budy: as for this weekend idk!
budy: what do you want to do the most
budy: would you want to visit a place or work on something 
budy: mini golf? bowling?
me: Well, I’m not always interesting to me, but you always are!
me: Well, I feel ok. It just makes me sad that I’m not making something at work.
me: You always help, you’re the best part of work! So thanks!
me: I am working on my game.
me: Hmm... if we visited a place, what place would we visit?
me: Haha we could do mini golf or bowling too haha I thought those were vetoed
me: ￼I made hot chocolate to make me happy
me: What are you up to?
me: The Madison subreddit showed me this beautiful website for a bar near my apartment
me: https://thecrystalcornerbar.com/
budy: hello
budy: we could do anything 
budy: hot chocolate! how wonderful 

budy: that’s the best website ever
budy: how’s your night going 
me: Hello
me: Well, hmm... I guess it would be fun to visit someplace. But where?
me: I want to see Milwaukee sometime but maybe more planning would be good!
me: My night is going well. I feel more accomplished.
me: How are you? What have you been up to?
budy: yeah milwaukee 
budy: nice!
budy: i’m pretty tired not doing much 
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: We could go if you want! We can get more specifics tomorrow (if you do want to go)
me: Well, that can be really nice to just chill.
me: Sorry I was sorta feeling bad :/ is everything ok?
budy: don’t feel sorry for feeling bad
budy: it happens 
budy: i haven’t really been feeling too great lately either even though i guess i’ve been doing well for the most part
budy: it happens 
budy: but are you feeling better? let me know if i can help you 
budy: and i’m down for doing something :) it might snow though so hmm
me: Haha I know, I just don’t want you to be disappointed
me: And yeah, of course I am here for you too, you are my best friend and I want you to be happy!
me: I am feeling better now, but I’ll probably be upset again tomorrow morning when I have to get up and go to work :|
me: Oh well!
me: I get to see you at least!
me: And yeah! You’re right it does look like snow. Do you know how much?
budy: well!
me: Well!
budy: well goodnight evan
budy: you are the best part of my days so i always hope you are well 
budy: i’ve been feeling very worthless lately and even though i don’t think much will help me feel better about myself,   i am at least happy to see you everyday
budy: you make my life brighter 
me: Hey, I understand how it can be hard to believe, but you are not worthless. At least from my perspective, you are my favorite person, the person with the biggest impact on my day-to-day life, and the person whose happiness is most important to me. I don’t think that’s worthless. I know I say that type of thing a lot so maybe it devalues it, but what you can’t see: I only say that to you just so you know. Honestly it’s pretty difficult for me to articulate exactly how I feel but you are very important to me and I want you to be happy. Goodnight 😴 I look forward to seeing you soon
me: How are you today, Vidya? I have not seen you so I miss you
budy: thanks for texting me last night and sorry for not responding to it, i don’t really know what to say in response but thanks for saying what you did
budy: i don’t take your support for granted and i really do appreciate everything you are
budy: and it is no way your fault that i feel like this, i don’t know
budy: i did miss seeing you today, sorry i couldn’t see you too much
budy: are you feeling ok today? you took your laptop home!
me: I thought you’d be asleep, so I wasn’t expecting a reply. You mean a lot to me and I just want you to be ok!
me: I really appreciate you too. I feel like you try hard to make me happy, which is something I really appreciate. You succeed by the way
me: Also know that it’s not your fault at all that I’ve been feeling upset. You make me feel better
me: And yes, I missed you today!
me: We will spend the weekend together!
me: I brought my laptop to finish looking over the survey but I have not done that yet. I’ve been on the phone with my family (and also napping)! So sorry for not texting you too. I miss you though
me: I am feeling ok today!
me: Are you doing ok today? I really hope you are well!
me: Also it looks like it’s not going to snow this weekend now.
me: Hey, is everything going alright? Just thinking about you. What are you up to?
budy: i’m doing alright
budy: thinking about me? awww 🥰 
budy: i was just talking on the phone
budy: i was feeling pretty meh today too
budy: but better now and everything’s generally alright i guess
budy: i’m glad you’re well today and got to talk to your family and i want to do whatever i can for you
budy: Feed me 🐱
budy: https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsAreAssholes/comments/aeo4a1/feed_me/?st=JQRLUYUJ&sh=1433e676
me: I’m glad you’re doing alright! If there’s anything I can do to help you do better than alright, I would love to know!
me: Yup, I was thinking about you which made me think of...
me: 🥰 Results Release 😍
me: Then I worked on putting the survey findings into a word document, but word crashed and I lost it all so I deleted all my Microsoft apps and reinstalled them.
me: Definitely a good use of time
me: That’s sweet :) it really makes me feel so good to have someone like you in my life, I’d feel so lost and confused without you I think
me: Oh my gosh! That’s such a cute kitten! I want a kitten! 🐱
me: Just such a little fluff ball!
me: I need to go to bed, I have a virtual care meeting at 8 :|
budy: goodnight evan
budy: i’m glad i make you think of...
budy: 🥰 Results Release 😍
me: (and...)
me: (🥰you😍)
me: (are pretty great too)
me: Goodnight Vidya 🐱
budy: 🐱 goodnight evan

budy: wow even
me: Vidyo
budy: (^ᴗ^)ノ
me: Wait! I was just about to go to your office!
budy: ok
budy: yay
me: Thanks for hanging out with me Vidya :) it makes me so happy to spend time with you! I don’t know what to do tomorrow but we can come up with something good to do 🤔
budy: :)
budy: goodnight sleep tight 
me: Hopefully you can sleep without the magic electric blanket now
budy: i’ll try
budy: i am going to sleep with my four blankets and hopefully that will be enough to quench my warmth desires 
budy: what should we do tomorrow?
me: Hello. I am awake now!
me: Did you sleep well?
me: I didn’t use my electric blanket actually but I slept well
me: I was so tired!
me: What should we do today?
budy: idk honestly might have to do some chores
budy: what do you want to do 
me: Well, we can do chores and something else! I have to do chores too (wash my dishes)
me: Hmm... well, we could obviously work on the light thing. We could watch Sowmya’s friends get drunk later haha are there other things you want to do?
budy: yeah! i have so much cleaning to do but yeah something after that would be good
budy: i would love to do something but i have been ignoring some basic tasks which i should do
budy: what are you up to now
budy: she says she’s going downtown to the bar at 6 and then her friends are coming at 9ish
budy: i have to see what sowmya’s plans are i guess
budy: i think i’ll be free to hang at maybe 4 if my plans go right...!
me: Cool! Maybe I can see your room after you clean it haha
me: Yeah I have to do some stuff too. We can aim to hang out after we are done! Just let me know, 4 sounds good!
me: Do you want to go to the bar too? It sounds kinda fun but it’s up to you
me: So Sowmya is leaving the bar at like 8 or something and her friends are going to your apartment?
me: I am working on my game but I should be cleaning!
budy: i think the bar thing might be only healthy planet thing so it might be awk to go
budy: and i think the friends who are coming here are not going to that
budy: as they all technically arent hp
budy: sounds like fun!
budy: you don’t haaaave to clean
me: Ok that’s what I was thinking too about the bar
me: Do you want to go to your apartment when her friends get there?
me: We could do that and it would be fun but we don’t haaaave to
budy: yeah!
budy: we could work on the project, get dinner and then come here
me: That sounds lovely :)
me: You can just let me know when you are done with your stuff and you can come here!
budy: what’s up
me: Hey Vidya! Not much, what are you up to?
me: Finished with your chores?
budy: yup!
me: Cool! Want to hang out? We could work on wall art or anything you want to do
budy: sure! are you free
budy: i’ll start heading over?
me: Oh I’m sorry I fell asleep! Yes you can head over!
me: I’m the worst :( I’m sorry
budy: are you tired? we can hang another time too!
budy: sorry it got late 
me: I’ve been sleeping a lot today but want to get up.
budy: do you want to eat first 
me: Yeah let’s do that.
budy: ok i can pick you up where should we go
me: If you’d rather we could go to dinner near you then hang out with Sowmya friends
me: Like it might not be worth going downtown if we are just planning to go back to your place?
me: I’m here! At the door near the playground
budy: ok 
budy: thanks for coming over evan! i’m glad we got dinner together that was really nice :)
budy: sowmya’s friends were pretty funny haha i did enjoy talking to them
budy: they were all good at stories and being funny haha 
budy: anyways i’m glad you were here and hope you make it home ok
budy: i’m glad we both got some tasks done too
budy: did you say you were going to the movie at 3? i guess we could hang out before or even after! 
budy: i really just like doing anything with you thanks for existing 
me: Made it home! I’m glad we got dinner too, it was really good!
me: Definitely have to go back there. Also just nice to get dinner with you :)
me: They were very good at telling stories! They were so funny!
me: How did you sleep?
me: I feel like I’m exceptionally bad at story telling. I’m sorry :/ I’m not very exciting really
me: Rad. Well if you want to hang out we can!
budy: just woke up
budy: good 
budy: how about you 
me: But yes! It was really nice to hang out, I just really like being together. You make me feel so content
me: Yeah, we could hang out before and/or after! I don’t know when they were thinking, there’s one at 3:50.
me: I woke up like an hour ago. I feel like I slept well though!
me: Still no plans for the day?
me: Thank you for existing too, I know it’s a lot of effort but I’m glad you do it
budy: nope 
me: I will ask Andrew what time the movie is
budy: you are plenty exciting for me
budy: i’m also not very interesting or good at stories so i ge it
budy: ok so
me: I think you are exciting even when you aren’t saying anything. Just being around you is very nice
budy: what should we do
me: That is the question, huh? Well there’s always our project, or we could find a game or something to play together
me: What do you want to do?
me: We obviously don’t have to do anything if there is nothing worthwhile to do haha
budy: when’s the movie again 
me: It is 3:50
budy: i mean i’m sure we can find something to do but i guess it would still be a short time
budy: we can always do something another day or even after the movie if that sounds good
me: Yeah, after the movie would work. Or another time. It’s like 2 hours so maybe it would be over at 5.
budy: also it’s ok if we don’t hang out today haha
me: Do you want to hang out today? It’s tricky because I want to see you but I don’t want to bore you because I just can’t think of anything to do!
budy: you wouldn’t bore me! i guess we can just what happens 
budy: i might go downtown just to see around and i’ll let you know if i do
budy: but might just stay and do stuff at home
budy: might be a good day to do that
me: Ok yeah you can just let me know what you do
me: Both things sound lovely haha
me: It would be fun to walk around downtown but it’s so cold!
me: We could still do it
me: Just let me know what you do and maybe we could do that thing together
budy: yeah it’s too cold
budy: yup
me: ￼
me: You can help me draw a 16x16 pixel fish I’m having a hard time
budy: it looks like a p good fish 
me: What are you up to, Vidya?
budy: nothing much i think sowmya just left to go for the movie 
budy: what are you up to
me: Doing nothing is fun.
me: I am leaving to go to the movie right now!
budy: nice i hope you like it!
me: I’ve just been working on my game, I got other characters to work
budy: i am enjoying doing nothing
me: We can talk about it after!
budy: yup i’m good are you good 
me: Yeah doing nothing is fun!
me: She said she was up until 4 with Zack? Oh no!
me: You’re just literally doing nothing? Do you have all four of your blankets?
me: Oh that’s nice! Sounds like fun
budy: yeah pretty much i talked to family read a little and watched that show 
me: Are you still at home?
budy: only the comforter actually 
me: The movie just ended
me: It was really good! It was cute and the animation was amazing!
budy: cool!
budy: Yeah I thought it was good too
me: Yeah, it was very sweet
me: What are you up to?
budy: Just at home
budy: what about you
me: Heading home. Probably won’t do anything I guess
me: But it’s nice just chilling
me: Have you talked to Sowmya today?
budy: Yeah I caught up in the mornig
budy: Lol
budy: Yeah some days chilling is good
me: Haha yeah that’s less than ideal
me: He’s probably upset you know which losing his job and stuff
me: Have you ever been blackout drunk? 
budy: Yeah I hope he’s ok
me: Yeah chilling is good but we need to find some more interesting things to do!
budy: Yeah and I dont drink much since that happened
budy: you?
budy: Sometimes I like to do nothing, I feel like its good for me sometimes
budy: But yes I’m sure we will come up with something
me: Mmm I’ve never gotten so drunk that I forget what I did. I don’t like feeling out of control
me: Yeah sometimes nothing is very cathartic
me: I’ve just been really tired this weekend for some reason
me: But seeing you a few times was nice!
me: We will come up with some cold weather things to do.
me: I don’t know how it works really, but it’s ok to do nothing together too. Like, I’d rather be doing nothing alongside you than alone sometimes I think. I feel guilty about that like we should be doing something but I think just doing nothing with someone is good too
budy: Idk yesterday kinda reminded me how I dislike drinking
budy: Anyways we will figure something out and ill se you tomorrow
me: Yeah, honestly, even before it got out of control it was still kind of uninteresting to just sit and drink.
me: How are you doing? Everything good?
me: Yeah! We will find stuff to do
me: Spider-Man wasn’t even especially sad but it still made me cry. Maybe I’m just feeling very emotional overall. But that’s not new. I’m going to draw. Sometimes that helps me. Plus the art in the movie was inspiring. But I’m good enough.
budy: yeah i thought it was pretty emotional
budy: how so emotional overall? and what are you gonna draw?
budy: i know i thought it was so cool with the style 
budy: good enough sounds ok.... i guess 
budy: is something bugging you?
me: Well... actually maybe I won’t draw. I was going to make a graphic novel but I know I won’t finish it so it’s not worth starting.
me: Yeah I’m fine, just the usual things bugging me. I had a weird dream last night that kind of bothered me, and I’m just in a weird mood
budy: hmm well i don’t know if it’s not worth starting 
budy: a dream that bothered you, that’s peculiar 
budy: what sort of bother? sometimes dreams can be unsettling 
budy: also what’s the graphic novel gonna be about 
budy: doing ok evan?
me: Hey I’m doing ok, I just fell asleep for a while... sorry for not texting you
me: Well, the graphic novel never got started clearly. If I think about it more I’ll tell you of course, but it’s not very fleshed out right now
me: I’m ok, but just not feeling well this weekend. I appreciate you looking out for me!
me: You’re so sweet
me: But yeah, I just have a lot on my mind.... like... I didn’t apply for grad school actually. I just couldn’t. It’s not what I want right now. I’m sorry I sort of lied about that. It was just really stressing me out. I wanted to tell you though.
me: I feel guilty.
me: Anyway, we don’t have to ever talk about that again! Just wanted to tell you.
me: Are you doing well? What have you been up to?
budy: i just want to make sure everythings ok! it’s ok that you didn’t apply to if you didn’t actually want to go, but i understand feeling guilty
budy: i am doing well! i actually ended up watching the rest of that show it was pretty good to watch while doing other stuff
budy: it’s kind of nice to spend time at home i did sleep quite a bit today and was lazy but i think it was needed
budy: and it was a “happy relaxing” kind of do nothing rather than the “i have no energy” do nothing 
budy: anyways let me know if there’s anything i can do for you
me: Yeah, it’s ok. Thanks for telling me that. It’s just hard for me to tell what I want sometimes, I feel like every choice I make is made because I want to make someone else happy
me: So I’ve been thinking more about what I really want. Which is hard.
me: I’m glad you’ve had a nice day! Honestly I should have just stayed home and not gone to the movie because it interrupted an otherwise perfect day of nothing
me: I did want to see it, but again- I chose to go because I thought Andrew wanted me to
me: But yes! Those happy relaxing days are very nice and very rare! I’m glad you took advantage of it :)
me: I’ll be good, I appreciate you, you know?
me: I do feel happier having told you I’m not going to grad school, so thanks!
me: You was actually a pretty good background show? Maybe I’ll have to do laundry to it sometime.
budy: yeah i am sometimes the same way of trying to please people and not knowing what i actually want to do, and saying no to things
budy: and then i get frustrated because later i realize i didn’t do what i actually wanted to do
budy: but anyways, it’s hard to know the balance between making yourself and others happy
budy: it was pretty good! i thought it was fun to watch and interesting 
me: Yeah, that’s exactly it. Well, if it means anything, I really want you to tell me if you ever want or don’t want to do something. I just want you to be happy, it’s important to me
me: But yeah so that’s what I’m trying: just to figure out what I really want.
me: Sometimes staying home doing nothing all day is exactly what I want! (And spending time with you, I enjoy that)
budy: yeah i guess it’s hard to know what you really want 
budy: you should let me know too, i honestly like being alone a lot and it’s really nothing against people 
budy: anyways goodnight evan i’ll see ya tomorrow
me: I also like being alone sometimes, so don’t worry, I get that. I promise to respect that about you
me: Goodnight, Vidya, I will also see you tomorrow ;)
budy: 💤
me: 🌙
budy: i’m in pqa 2 now 😎
me: Oh! Nice job! He accepted your closed-not fixing?
budy: yeah he did
budy: but i also made a new menu 
budy: i just changed it back to the old menu now 
budy: want 2 walk 2 borealis
me: Vidya can you help me with the gold star stuff? I am 2 confused
me: Nevermind, jerry showed me.
me: But it’s still really dumb
budy: wait do you need help
me: Come here for a second?
budy: sure
me: Well, you are close!
me: Did you get your thingy submitted?
me: I was supposed to talk on the phone today but my call was canceled.
me: Now I have nothing to do!
me: Just kidding I’m very good at entertaining myself
me: But I have no plans anymore
budy: no didn’t finish 
budy: who were you calling?
budy: well now you can enjoy free-ness
me: Well, I was just going to talk to one of my friends actually, but that’s ok.
me: I can enjoy freeness! I started watching the show Atypical. Have you watched it? So far very good!
me: What are you up to?
budy: oh i see
budy: i haven’t seen that
budy: just chilling not doing too much
me: Did you mail the shoes?
me: Alternatively you can ask to visit them in Chicago
me: I looked up the beer and cheese fest that jerry was talking about. It’s $50! It would probably be pretty fun but I dunno if I can consume $50 worth of beer and cheese. What do you think?
budy: no i did put the box in my car though 
budy: i left work at 6:30ish and wasn’t feeling like i’d make it
budy: also: no i probably am not up to it, but you should go if you want
me: Well, that’s a step in the right direction!
me: That’s fair. I should’ve stayed later, I’m really falling behind
me: And yeah, I do not think it would be worth it to go so I will not either ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: Jeez it’s going to be so cold this weekend :(
budy: time to change the weather to f and pretend its warm
me: That’s a perfect solution for you, but unfortunately I am already accustomed to f. If only I could turn it to kelvin
me: Well, we can go bowling. That is inside where it is warm
me: How has your evening been?
budy: it’s good, sowmya’s still not home so i’m wondering where she went
budy: how’s your night been
me: Hmm 🤔 that’s very mysterious maybe she’s getting drunk at Zach’s house or sleeping in her office like Joe.
me: Those two are a bad influence
budy: she said she’s coming back
me: My night has been fine. Just chilling.
me: That’s good! Where was she?
budy: she was working w joe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: Wow they are hard workers
me: Well that’s cool
budy: i think she got stc back so she’s probably working on that 
me: That makes sense.
me: That’s not the most fun thing to work on past midnight, I can think of one better thing.
me: ￼... do you remember this?
budy: i do!
me: Jerry said you all were talking about prom potatoes at lunch?
budy: fiona said that
me: Did you ever go to prom?
budy: yeah did you 
budy: how’s the day going 
me: I’m going to need more details than that, Vidya, and maybe a picture of your prom dress too
me: Who’d you go with?
me: I guess you can answer these questions when we aren’t working.
me: My day is going well, I only have 20 distinct tasks to do now!
me: That’s a lot }:(
budy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
me: How is your day?
budy: i think i’m gonna go home!
budy: after 5 rounds of pqa
me: You should! I’m feeling very tired of doing work
budy: i am officially done!
me: Jeez! That guy is fast!
me:  Congrats!
budy: how’s life e v a n
me: I got my UC Davis logins the day Nick got back 🤦‍♂️
budy: at least he’s back 
budy: i actually haven’t gotten logins for both of my backups yo
budy: yet
me: Yup, now it’s not my problem! But he’s probably not impressed with my performance as a backup
me: What are you up to? I just got out of a few meetings
budy: what’s up e van
me: Not much, v idya! Just chilling. I kind of have a headache tho
me: It’s not bad.
me: Are you studying hard?
budy: i see
budy: no
budy: i don’t feel like it
me: Well what are you up to? Anything?
me: Tell me about when you went to prom. Who did you go with?
budy: hmmm i just had the “OPT” or “” for for the subset entry point
budy: yeah that’s what i think
budy: is it not working hmm
budy: hmm
budy: do you have it after the $$input line
budy: finished calling my family 
budy: how are you now 
budy: cool!
me: Canceled your test?
budy: yup
budy: how’s life 
me: That’s good you can put it off like I am doing
me: Montefiore is so stressful! James warned me they were very New Yorker-ish and it’s true: they’re very pushy and just sound annoyed all the time
me: And I have a headache so I’m just going to my default not working thing: auto hot key
me: How are you?
budy: hey evan, thanks for walking with me
budy: sorry i wasn’t very talkative today or closed off
budy: we should definitely plan to work on the installation this weekend if you want
budy: could we dedicate the saturday to it?
budy: how are you doing now
me: Hey :) it was really nice to walk it’s you! (In fact, when I walk with you to Zodiac that’s also farther for me, but I still do it!)
me: You don’t have to apologize! I didn’t think you were closed off, and even if you were, I just enjoy being next to you even without saying anything
me: So don’t worry!
me: Yeah! We should definitely do that this weekend! We need to just commit a day, so Saturday sounds good :D
me: Also, I’m sorry you are feeling tired. It’s probably because your purpose in life is broken. We can make it better this weekend too.
me: I am fine, just got home. Not doing anything yet. How are you doing?
me: I hope you’re doing well, Vidya, I want for you to be happy because I like you a lot
budy: yeah i’m fine, thanks for checking 
budy: how are you?
budy: i forgot about the movie night 
budy: anyways what are you up to 
me: Yeah I had that on my calendar but decided not to go since my head hurts :/
me: I am fine. Nothing too interesting going on.
me: What are you up to?
budy: still hurting?
me: Yeah, kind of :(
budy: awww
me: That’s ok! Just resting is nice. Though I’m not sleepy at all since I got like 11 hours last night.
me: What are you up to?
budy: hi how’s it e
budy: hi how’s it going 
me: Pretty good. Just did an EQU call. How are you?
budy: good!
budy: doing inbasket 
me: Wow! Learning lots, I imagine?
me: It’s going to snow a lot tonight, maybe we can actually build a snowman!
me: Are you still here?
budy: nope 
budy: just got home 
budy: are you leaving 
me: I am leaving now!
me: You looked so majestic in your snap! *•*
me: Yup I’m going to leave! I guess it’ll just be a snowy evening at home
budy: snow!
budy: yeah¯\_(ツ)_/¯
budy: i guess i’ll try to write a few more emails
budy:  drive safe!
me: How was driving?
me: I could drive to your house and we could sit like cats in front of your fireplace at a certain point
budy: if it’s safe!
budy: are you at home
me: I hate snow driving but I opposite of hate you so it might balance out.
me: No I’m still a ways away :|
me: Very slow
me: Made it home!
me: Yeah, I mean, it’s also ok to just stay inside all weekend if that’s what you’d like
budy: yay you made it
budy: sowmya isn’t back yet
budy: yeah i’m not too sure of what i’ll feel like doing 
budy: would you want to do that?
me: Yay!
me: Hmm 🤔 so you haven’t seen Sowmya in like two days?
me: Yeah, well, I don’t know what I feel like doing either, but just snuggling with blankets watching a movie or something is nice when it’s snowy
me: I would love to hang out with you, but I’d understand if you didn’t want to, it’d be sort of a commitment at this point: It is getting kind of bad, so I guess if I went there I’d have to plan on staying the night.
budy: yeah i’m not sure what to do
budy: i mean maybe it won’t be snowy tomorrow?
budy: what are you going to do tonight
me: Well, I guess now it’s dark too. I suppose we can see how tomorrow is
me: It might be icy. Sometimes it’s better while it’s still snowing
me: I have no plans! I guess just sleep. What about you?
budy: yeah i don’t i’ll probably just read and then sleep!
budy: yay
budy: whatcha doing now?
me: I fell asleep for a bit :|
me: Andrew was here earlier but he must’ve gone to Amaya’s or something.
me: What are you up to? Reading?
me: Did you ever finish Dune?
me: I’m going to make hot chocolate
budy: yeah i ate and caught up with family 
budy: now gonna read or watch something maybe 
budy: or draw idk
budy: basically what i usually do
budy: i haven’t finished dune yet but hopefully soon 
budy: maybe this weekend with all this time 
budy: oooh hot chocolate
budy: idk i’ve been feeling very drained lately and talking is hard
budy: stay warm under your blanket!
budy: did you see this 
budy: ￼
budy: from reddit 
me: Catching up with family is good
me: Any of those activities are perfect for a snowy day!
me: I guess we are a little trapped by the snow.
budy: do you leave your wipers up in the snow
me: Yeah, I’ve been feeling not very talkative too lately. I guess I’ve been feeling alone, but like content alone.
me: Yes, you should leave them up so they don’t get frozen down ;)
me: I intend to stay warm under my blanket!
me: That’s a really cool picture! Have you seen Paul’s desktop background? It reminds me of that!
me: I showed Paul the Mendota freezing data visualizations from reddit too haha
me: Also I’m sorry you feel drained. What helps you recharge?
budy: i don’t know im reading conflicting things about wipers up
budy: i haven’t seen pauls bg
budy: im fine but yeah i think im feeling content being alone
budy: i’ll just try to rest a lot and eat well this weekend 
budy: but anyways it already seems like a lot of snow has built up!
me: Oh yeah? What do the proponents of wipers down say?
me: It looks like that
me: Yeah, it’s weird, at the same time I really want to be with you but I don’t feel like I’d be exciting or anything
me: Yeah that’s probably good. Eating and sleeping well will help you gain more energy.
me: That’s what I should do too
me: Yeah! It’s perfect for a snowman!
me: Just wanted to tell you, I want you to feel better from whatever is bothering you. Being alone is good sometimes for that. It’s hard to resist you, but I’ll leave you be; I’ll still “opposite-of-hate” you if you don’t want to talk. Hope you’re ok, Vidya :) your kindness and supportiveness have made you one of my favorite people ever
budy: yeah, today might just be alone day for me, hope your saturday is going well!
budy: whatcha up to?
budy: hope you’re doing ok, let me know how you are
me: Hey, Vidya! Yeah, I’m doing fine! Just working on my game.
me: Sometimes alone days are just what you need, so that’s ok!
me: What are you up to?
me: Also are you doing good? If something is upsetting you, you I’m always here to talk to
me: Sowmya said you were feeling bad? I’m sorry. If I can help let me know, I figured you just needed some time to rest
budy: i’m fine but i some days i feel like being alone 
budy: not really against anyone so definitely don’t think this is your fault in any way
budy: i guess i already told you i’ve been feeling low energy, i hadn’t seen sowmya in a while so she didn’t know 
budy: how’s the game going?
me: Haha yeah I mean I’m the same way, it’s nice sometimes to be alone
me: I don’t blame you at all!
me: Have you had a good day?
me: I know it’s not anyone’s fault either, so don’t worry. I guess we do spend a lot of time together though so if you ever do get tired of that let me know
me: My game is going well! I’m working on making NPCs find paths between two points but it is not working 🤔
budy: i’m not tired of you!
budy: hmm i see
budy: sounds challenging 
me: I’m glad! I’m not tired of you either
me: Yes hmm
me: I already tried recycling the app pools.
me: What have you been up to today?
me: Lmao figured it out... they couldn’t find a path because there was a wall on the starting position... themselves. They were blocked by themselves.
me: I am glad to hear you’re doing ok :)
me: Hey Vidya, just thinking about you. How are you feeling today? You really are someone very important to me so I hope you are good. I guess I’m going sledding with Sowmya later... I texted Sowmya yesterday mostly because I wanted to ask  if she had seen you but got roped into sledding too. I kinda just wanted to stay home all day. Oh well. Either way, I hope you are good
budy: i’m fine and have been enjoying some quality solitude, have been trying to use my phone less, but i am unsuccessful what have you been up to?
budy: i’m sorry i won’t be coming for sledding probably and that you’re roped into it
budy: hope you are well!
me: I’m glad you’re enjoying your solitude! Avoiding your phone is very nice sometimes
me: Sledding is really cold. Kinda miserably so. With this amount of sun in Colorado it would be like mid-50s but not here!
me: I’ve been just working on my game and stuff. Nothing too interesting.
me: What have you been up to?
budy: i see! do you have any pictures?
budy: still seems fun but cold 
budy: yeah it got really hot in our apartment 
budy: i’ve been reading and napping and on the computer for the most part, pretty boring but fun for me!
budy: how are you 
me: I don’t! It’s so sad! I was trying to take a picture but my phone got too cold and shut off :(
me: Fun but cold is accurate. My nose still hurts.
me: Reading and napping and computering are all fun things! It’s so nice to have a day to just chill! Glad you had fun!
me: I’m good, back at home which is lovely
budy: oh no! oh well though 
budy: were there a lot of other people?
budy: hope your nose feels better 
budy: and i’m glad it’s all lovely 
budy: i kinda have missed seeing you though
me: Yeah there were a lot of people! And they all walked up the middle which is dumb because then they get hit! We almost hit one kid
me: We also tried to do a “train” with all of us connected in a row, which was all good until we hit some bumps.
me: Then it was painful! And I got a ton of snow in my face and eyes
me: (But still fun!)
me: I have missed you a lot. It’s nice to see you.
me: You very consistently text me like “thanks for hanging out” but I haven’t gotten one of those in a while I was thinking! It’s silly but very sweet
budy: fun is pain!!!
budy: i see i guess that’s because we haven’t hung out
budy: sorry about that!
budy: i feel kinda bad about it, do you want to hang out today?
budy: we could get dinner or something?
me: Fun is so cold >:(
me: Oh no! That’s ok! Don’t feel guilty!
me: I’m not saying that I’m unhappy, I’m just saying that I really like you as a person and value our time together!
me: Sometimes being cozy at home is wonderful, so don’t worry!
budy: ok well if you do want to hang out let me know!
budy: i do kinda want to see you but also it’s cold 
budy: brrr
me: I would love to see you too! It is cold though brrr we could just get dinner and not have to go outside
me: Or get dinner some other night, whatever you’d like for your weekend of solitude
budy: hmmm
budy: why do we live so far apart 
budy: maybe i’ll just see you in the spring lol
me: Can I move in and live on your couch?
me: I don’t like being so far from work (and you)!
budy: omg it’s staff meeting tomorrow
me: Thanks for calling me ;) you fascinate me, Vidya. Hopefully it will get warmer so we can spend time together because I miss how fulfilled I feel with you
me: Oh yes! It is! Popcorn time!
me: Nothing gets done on staff meeting days, so that’s good
me: Jeez we’re getting another 5-6 inches of snow Tuesday :|
budy: uh oh
budy: during the day?
budy: do we know the time
